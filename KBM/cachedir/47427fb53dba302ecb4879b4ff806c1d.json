Barstow See Article History Rape act of sexual intercourse with an individual without his or her consent, through force or the threat of force.\nIn many jurisdictions, the crime of rape has been subsumed under that of sexual assault, which also encompasses acts that fall short of intercourse.\nRape was long considered to be caused by unbridled sexual desire, but it is now understood as pathological assertion of power over victim.\nScope, effects, and motivations The legal definition of rape has changed substantially since the late 20th century.\nThe traditional definition was narrow with respect to both gender and age; rape was an act of sexual intercourse by man with woman against her will.\nAs rape is now understood, rapist or victim may be an adult of either gender or child.\nAlthough rape can occur in same-sex intercourse, it is most often committed by male against female.\nThere is also an increasing tendency to treat as rape an act of sexual intercourse by husband with his wife against her will and to consider forced prostitution and sexual slavery as forms of rape.\nRape is often explained or excused as manifestation of racial, ethnic, and class hatred or as stemming from patriarchal system in which women are viewed as the property of men.\nWhatever its origins, rape is serious crime and is treated as felony in most countries with common-law systems.\nIn many rape trials, the guilt or innocence of the accused hinges on whether or not the victim consented to sexual intercourse.\nThe determination of consent often can lead to distressing cross-examinations of rape victims in court.\nAs result, many rape victims choose not to report the crime to police or refuse to press charges against their assailants.\nAccording to study conducted in the United States in the 1990s, for example, fewer than one-third of rapes in the country are reported to police, and about half of all rape victims do not discuss the incident with anyone.\nEven when brought to trial, those charged with rape have higher-than-average rate of acquittal, mainly because it is difficult to prove crime for which there are usually no third-party witnesses and because the testimony of women often may be given less credence than that of men.\nRape is thus both underreported and underprosecuted.\nTo protect women from humiliating cross-examination, many jurisdictions have adopted rape shield laws, which limit the ability of the defendant\u2019s counsel to introduce the accuser\u2019s sexual history as evidence.\nThe psychological motivations of rapists are more complex than was formerly thought.\nThey may include the desire to punish, to gain revenge, to cause pain, to prove sexual prowess, and to control through fear.\nThe psychological reactions of victims of rape also vary but usually include feelings of shame, humiliation, confusion, fear, and rage.\nVictims often report feeling of perpetual defilement, an inability to feel clean, an overwhelming sense of vulnerability, and paralyzing feeling of lack of control over their lives.\nMany are haunted by fear of the place in which the crime occurred, or of being followed, or of all sexual relationships.\nOthers experience long-term disruption of sleep or eating patterns or an inability to function at work.\nThe duration of the psychological trauma varies from individual to individual; many feel the effects for years, even with considerable supportive therapy.\nIn view of the great psychological harm it causes, many psychologists regard rape as form of torture\u2014a permanent mutilation of an individual\u2019s life.\nIn addition to these psychological effects, in some societies victims of rape face the danger of ostracism or even death at the hands of relatives seeking to preserve their family\u2019s honour victims of abduction without rape may be treated in the same way Get exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription.\nSubscribe today Statutory rape The age at which an individual may give effective consent to sexual intercourse is commonly set in most countries at between 14 and 18 years though it is as low as 12 years in some countries Sexual intercourse with person below the age of consent is termed statutory rape, and consent is no longer relevant.\nThe term statutory rape specifically refers to the legal proscription against having sexual intercourse with child or any other person presumed to lack comprehension of the physical and other consequences of the act.\nThe term statutory rape may also refer to any kind of sexual assault committed against person above the age of consent by an individual in position of authority e.g., employers, teachers, clergy, doctors, and parents Statutory rape often leaves the victim with long-term psychological and physical damage, including sexually transmitted diseases and the inability to bear children.\nFor example, statutory rape was particularly prevalent in South Africa in the period following the abolition of apartheid, when it was estimated that some two-fifths of South African rape victims were under age 18.\nMany rapes in the country were committed in the mistaken belief that sexual intercourse with virgin including an infant would cure the rapist of HIV/AIDS.\nAccording to Interpol, in the early 21st century there were more rapes per capita in South Africa than in any other country.\n2009 study conducted by the Medical Research Council in South Africa showed that more than quarter of South African men said they had committed rape.\nNearly three-quarters of those men committed their first rape before reaching age 20, and nearly half of them were repeat offenders.\nMany of the participants expressed no remorse for the assaults.\nEnter your email Subscribe By signing up for this email, you are agreeing to news, offers, and information from Encyclopaedia Britannica.\nClick here to view our Privacy Notice.\nEasy unsubscribe links are provided in every email.\nThank you for subscribing!\nBe on the lookout for your Britannica newsletter to get trusted stories delivered right to your inbox.\nStay Connected Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram Pinterest Newsletters About Us Legal Info Partner Program Contact Us Privacy Notice Terms of Use (C)2020 Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.\nYour preference has been recorded close Check out Britannica's new site for parents!\n"}
