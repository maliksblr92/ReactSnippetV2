Professor of American Literary and Cultural History, University of T\u00fcbingen Disclosure statement Annabel Bligh works for The Conversation, which received funding from the Comparative Analysis of Conspiracy Theories research network COST Action COMPACT to make this podcast.\nPartners View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger How are the origins of the French Revolution connected with Beyonc\u00e9, Jay and Rihanna?\nThe answer lies with one of the world\u2019s most mysterious and misunderstood secret societies, the Illuminati.\nThe strange evolution of the conspiracy theory surrounding this short-lived secret society, mirrors the modern history of conspiracy theories.\nWe find out how in part three of our podcast series.\nThe Illuminati was real secret society of intellectual elites in the late 18th century.\nMichael Butter, professor of American literary and cultural history at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany, tells us their goal was to promote Enlightenment thinking ideas such as rational thought and the separation of church and state.\nTheir goal was to transform society.\nNot violently by causing revolution.\nBut by educating people.\nBy planting ideas in the minds of people over very, very long period of time.\nThe society only lasted few years before being forced to disband by the conservative authorities of the tine.\nBut conspiracy theorists say the Illuminati never really disappeared.\nThey were accused of orchestrating the French Revolution, which started in 1789.\nAndreas \u00d6nnerfors, associate professor of intellectual history at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, says it was such violent revolution and caused so much upheaval across Europe that people looked for someone to blame.\nWithin couple of years, you were going from an absolutist monarchy that is underpinned by Catholicism as state ideology to secular republic where religion is completely wiped out as the foundation of statehood.\nSo it is radical change.\n\u00d6nnerfors explains how the Illuminati conspiracy theory emerged as part of conservative backlash against the revolution.\nPoliticians in Britain were afraid the upheaval would spread across the Channel and there were people in France who wanted to turn the clock back on the revolution.\nThey started pushing the idea that there were nefarious forces at work behind the scenes and blamed the Illuminati for masterminding the whole outcome of the revolution.\nWe find out how the Illuminati became the bogeyman for dark forces at work in the world.\nThen, how the conspiracy theory dramatically morphed in the 20th century.\nFirst, following the publication of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, fake transcript of secret meeting of Jewish leaders plotting world domination.\nThe document was quickly proven to be piece of fiction but nonetheless became powerful piece of political propaganda.\nGrouping Jews together with the pre-existing ideas of the Illuminati made for toxic mix.\nThen, after the second world war, we discover how the Illuminati conspiracy theory was picked up by conservatives in the US and played part in fuelling anti-communist witch hunts.\nAnd researcher Lindsay Porter explains how things took weird turn in the 1960s when elements of the counterculture began to parody the conspiracy theory.\nTwo Playboy editors published an 800-page work of fiction called The Illuminatus!\nIt accused everyone they could think of including Martian invaders of being part of the Illuminati.\nBut instead of killing the conspiracy theory, people started quoting the book as if it was real expos\u00e9.\nFinally, we reach the present day and find out how various pop stars are now accused of being part of this secret society that rules the world.\nIn many ways it\u2019s highly entertaining.\nAs Porter tell us, however, it also has dark undertones, often incorporating sexism and racism.\nThe Anthill podcast is produced by Annabel Bligh and Gemma Ware.\nSound design is by Eloise Stevens, with original music from Neeta Sarl and audio fromEpidemic Sound.\n"}
