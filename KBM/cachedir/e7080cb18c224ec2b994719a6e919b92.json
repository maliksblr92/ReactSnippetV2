Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.\nOctober 2018 ---|--- Dell Inc.\nIn 2015, Dell acquired the enterprise technology firm EMC Corporation; following the completion of the purchase, Dell and EMC became divisions of Dell Technologies.\nThe dorm-room headquartered company sold IBM PC-compatible computers built from stock components.[14] Dell dropped out of school to focus full-time on his fledgling business, after getting $1,000 in expansion-capital from his family.\nIn 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the Turbo PC which sold for $795.[15] PC's Limited advertised its systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers and custom assembled each ordered unit according to selection of options.\nThe company grossed more than $73 million in its first year of operation.\nIn 1986, Michael Dell brought in Lee Walker, 51-year-old venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as Dell's mentor and implement Dell's ideas for growing the company.\nWalker was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988.\nGrowth in the 1990s and early 2000s Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably-low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed when the company's Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997.\nWhile the industry's average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell.\nDell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days.\nIn early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced product line designed especially for individual users.[20] From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps.\nDuring the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, IBM, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out.[21] Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999.\nDell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.[3] Dell attained and maintained the top rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to Consumer Reports year after year, during the mid-to-late 1990s through 2001 right before Windows XP was released.\nIn 1996, Dell began selling computers through its website.\nIn the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers.\nThe major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system.\nThree years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31 percent of the market.\nU.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market which purchases PCs in upgrade cycles had largely decided to take break from buying new systems.\nConsumers had become the main drivers of PC sales in recent years,[34] yet there had decline in consumers purchasing PCs through the Web or on the phone, as increasing numbers were visiting consumer electronics retail stores to try out the devices first.\nHunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting \"got in the way,\" aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call.\nBy 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just few months to improve on this and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly.\nIn July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional \"bloatware\" on PCs.\nThe call-center had opened in 2006 after the city of Ottawa won bid to host it.\nLess than year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers add new building.\nThe desktop production plant in Winston- Salem, North Carolina, received US$280 million in incentives from the state and opened in 2005, but ceased operations in November 2010.\nDell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android.[54][55] The Dell Streak was failure commercially and critically due to its outdated OS, numerous bugs, and low resolution screen.\nIn December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.[59] In the shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo in 2011 to fall to number three in the world.\nDell and fellow American contemporary Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins.\nAfter the buyout, the newly private Dell offered Voluntary Separation Program that they expected to reduce their workforce by up to seven percent.\nBecause Dell already had an efficient manufacturing process, integrating EqualLogic's products into the company drove manufacturing prices down [91][92][93] Perot Systems 2009 Perot Systems was technology services and outsourcing company, mainly active in the health-sector, founded by former presidential hopeful H. Ross Perot.\nThe acquired business provided Dell with applications development, systems integration, and strategic consulting services through its operations in the U.S. and 10 other countries.\nIn addition, the acquisition of Perot brought variety of business process outsourcing services, including claims processing and call center operations.\n[94][95][96] KACE Networks February 10, 2010 KACE Networks was leader in systems management appliances.\n[97] Boomi November 2, 2010 Cloud integration leader [98] Compellent February 2011 The acquisition extended Dell's storage solution[ buzzword portfolio.\n[99] Force10 networks August 2011 By acquiring this company Dell now has the full Intellectual property for their networking portfolio, which was lacking on the Dell PowerConnect range as these products are powered by Broadcom or Marvell IM.\n[100] AppAssure Software February 24, 2012 Dell acquired the backup and disaster recovery software solution provider out of Reston, VA.\nAppAssure delivered 194 percent revenue growth in 2011 and over 3500% growth in the prior three years.\nAppAssure supported physical servers and VMware, Hyper-V and XenServer.\nThe deal represents the first acquisition since Dell formed its software division under former CA CEO John Swainson.\nDell added that it will keep AppAssure's 230 employees and invest in the company.\n[101] SonicWall May 9, 2012 company with 130 patents, SonicWall develops security products, and is network and data security provider.\n[102][103] Wyse April 2, 2012 global market-leader for thin client systems.\n[101][104] Clerity Solutions April 3, 2012 Clerity, company offering services for application re hosting, was formed in 1994 and has it headquarters in Chicago.\nAt the time of the take-over approximately 70 people were working for the company.\n[101][105] Quest Software September 28, 2012 [106][107][108][109] Gale Technologies November 16, 2012 provider of infrastructure automation products.\nGale Technologies was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.\n[110] Credant Technologies December 18, 2012 provider of storage protection solutions.\nCredant is the 19th acquisition in four years, as Dell had spent $13 billion on acquisitions since 2008 and $5 billion in the past year alone.\n[111][112] StatSoft March 24, 2014 global provider of analytics software, in order to bolster its big data solutions offering.\n[113] Acquisition of EMC On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation.\nElliott argued[118] this structure deeply undervalued EMC's core \"EMC II\" data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies.\nThe top floor continued to hold Dell's board room, demonstration center, and visitor meeting room.\n100 senior executives were scheduled to work in the building by the end of 2000.[145] In January 2001, the company leased the space in Las Cimas 2, located along Loop 360.\nLas Cimas housed Dell's executives, the investment operations, and some corporate functions.\nIt leased all of Las Cimas and II, with total of 312,000 square feet 29,000 m2 for about seven-year period after 2003.\nFacilities located abroad include Penang, Malaysia; Xiamen, China; Bracknell, UK; Manila, Philippines[149] Chennai, India;[150] Hyderabad, India; Noida, India; Hortolandia and Porto Alegre, Brazil; Bratislava, Slovakia; \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland;[151] Panama City, Panama; Dublin and Limerick, Ireland; Casablanca, Morocco and Montpellier, France.\nIn contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on quarterly basis.[153] To minimize the delay between purchase and delivery, Dell has general policy of manufacturing its products close to its customers.\nThis also allows for implementing just-in-time JIT manufacturing approach, which minimizes inventory costs.\nLow inventory is another signature of the Dell business model\u2014a critical consideration in an industry where components depreciate very rapidly.[154] Dell's manufacturing process covers assembly, software installation, functional testing including \"burn-in\" and quality control.\nDell began manufacturing in Limerick in 1991 and went on to become Ireland's largest exporter of goods and its second-largest company and foreign investor.\nWhether this facility will remain in Ireland is not certain.[162] Construction of EMF4 in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland has started[update]: Dell started production there in autumn 2007.[163] Dell opened plants in Penang, Malaysia in 1995, and in Xiamen, China in 1999.\nThese facilities serve the Asian market and assemble 95% of Dell notebooks.\nDell Inc. has invested[ when? an estimated $60 million in new manufacturing unit in Chennai, India, to support the sales of its products in the Indian subcontinent.\nIts Business/Corporate class represent brands where the company advertising emphasizes long life-cycles, reliability, and serviceability.\nThese brands include: Inspiron budget desktop and notebook computers XPS high-end desktop and notebook computers Alienware high-performance gaming systems Venue Tablets Android Windows Dell's Peripherals class includes USB keydrives, LCD televisions, and printers; Dell monitors includes LCD TVs, plasma TVs and projectors for HDTV and monitors.\nDell UltraSharp is further high-end brand of monitors.\nMichael Dell, the founder of the company, serves as chairman of the board and chief executive officer.\nOther board members include Don Carty, Judy Lewent, Klaus Luft, Alex Mandl, and Sam Nunn.\nShareholders elect the nine board members at meetings, and those board members who do not get majority of votes must submit resignation to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation.\nThe board of directors usually sets up five committees having oversight over specific matters.\nDell has regional senior vice-presidents for countries other than the United States, including David Marmonti for EMEA and Stephen J. Felice for Asia/Japan.\nAs of 2007[update], other officers included Martin Garvin senior vice president for worldwide procurement and Susan Sheskey vice president and Chief Information Officer .[ citation needed Marketing Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, catalogs and newspapers.\nSome of Dell Inc's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products such as Dell printers and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors.\nIn 2006, Dell cut its prices in an effort to maintain its 19.2% market share.\nThis also cut profit margins by more than half, from 8.7 to 4.3 percent.\nIn July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines.\nCustomers who visit Dell India official site are given the option to buy online which then will be redirected to Dell affiliate website compuindia.com.[152] Global analytics Dell also operates captive analytics division which supports pricing, web analytics, and supply chain operations.\nDGA operates as single, centralized entity with global view of Dell's business activities.\nDell stopped this practice in 1994, citing low profit margins on the business, exclusively distributing through direct- sales model for the next decade.\nIn 2003, Dell briefly sold products in Sears stores in the U.S. In 2007, Dell started shipping its products to major retailers in the U.S. once again, starting with Sam's Club and Wal-Mart.\nStaples, the largest office-supply retailer in the U.S., and Best Buy, the largest electronics retailer in the U.S., became Dell retail partners later that same year.\nKiosks Starting in 2002, Dell opened kiosk locations in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company.\nStarting in 2005, Dell expanded kiosk locations to include shopping malls across Australia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong.\nIn April 2008, Future Shop and Best Buy began carrying subset of Dell products, such as certain desktops, laptops, printers, and monitors.\nSince some shoppers in certain markets show reluctance to purchase technological products through the phone or the Internet, Dell has looked into opening retail operations in some countries in Central Europe and Russia.\nIn April 2007, Dell opened retail store in Budapest.\nIn October of the same year, Dell opened retail store in Moscow.\nIn the UK, HMV's flagship Trocadero store has sold Dell XPS PCs since December 2007.\nFrom January 2008 the UK stores of DSGi have sold Dell products in particular, through Currys and PC World stores As of 2008, the large supermarket-chain Tesco has sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.\nIn May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, Officeworks part of Coles Group to stock few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range.\nThese models have slightly different model numbers, but almost replicate the ones available from the Dell Store.\nDell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with Harris Technology another part of Coles Group in November of the same year.\nIn addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with the discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for \"Slashing Prices\". Dell agreed to distribute variety of makes of both desktops and notebooks, including Studio and XPS systems in late 2008.\nAs of 2009[update], Dell continues to run and operate its various kiosks in 18 shopping centres throughout Australia.\nOn March 31, 2010, Dell announced to Australian Kiosk employees that they were shutting down the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.\nIn Germany, Dell is selling selected smartphones and notebooks via Media Markt and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.[185] Competition Dell's major competitors include Hewlett-Packard HP Hasee, Acer, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Gateway, Sony, Asus, Lenovo, IBM, MSI, Panasonic, Samsung and Apple.\nDell and its subsidiary, Alienware, compete in the enthusiast market against AVADirect, Falcon Northwest, VoodooPC subsidiary of HP and other manufacturers.\nIn the second quarter of 2006, Dell had between 18% and 19% share of the worldwide personal computer market, compared to HP with roughly 15%. In late 2006[update], Dell lost its lead in the PC-business to Hewlett- Packard.\nBoth Gartner and IDC estimated that in the third quarter of 2006, HP shipped more units[186] worldwide than Dell did.\nDell's 3.6% growth paled in comparison to HP's 15% growth during the same period.\nIDC's Q4 2006 estimates show Dell's share of the server market at 8.1%, down from 9.5% in the previous year.\nThis represents an 8.8% loss year-over-year, primarily to competitors EMC and IBM.\nPartnership with EMC In 2001, Dell and EMC entered into partnership whereby both companies jointly design products and Dell provided support for certain EMC products including midrange storage systems, such as fibre channel and iSCSI storage area networks.\nThe relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.[188] On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of the strategic partnership with EMC.\nDell's 2008 CSR report ranked as \"Application Level B\" as \"checked by GRI\".[203] The company aims to reduce its external environmental impact through an energy-efficient evolution of products, and also reduce its direct operational impact through energy-efficiency programs.\nInternal energy-efficiency programs reportedly save the company more than $3 million annually in energy-cost savings.\nThe largest component of the company's internal energy-efficiency savings comes through PC power management: the company expects to save $1.8 million in energy costs through using specialized energy-management software on network of 50,000 PCs.\nCriticism See also: Lawsuits involving Dell Inc.\nIn the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily ATX motherboards and PSU to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors.\nThis meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts.\nIssues included call transfers[207] of more than 45% of calls and long wait times.\nDell's blog detailed the response: \"We're spending more than $100 million\u2014and lot of blood, sweat, and tears of talented people\u2014to fix this.\"[208] Later in the year, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150 million.[209] Since 2018, Dell has seen significant increase in consumer satisfaction.\nIn 2010 Dell finally paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud.\nIn the first instance, Dell offered 19\" LCD panel for $15.\nThe consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1 million US$31250 for customer rights infringements.\nMany consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation.\n\"Dell Company Profile\".
