Carbon, Director of the Office on Violence Against Women. In victory for survivors of rape and their advocates, the Attorney General announced newly revised definition of rape for nationwide data collection, ensuring that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.\nThe change sends an important message to all victims that what happens to them matters, and to perpetrators that they will be held accountable.\nIt was because of the voices of survivors, advocates, law enforcement personnel and many others that FBI Director Robert Mueller was able to make this important change within the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Report UCR Summary Reporting System SRS \u201cForcible rape\u201d had been defined by the UCR SRS as \u201cthe carnal knowledge of female, forcibly and against her will.\u201d\nThat definition, unchanged since 1927, was outdated and narrow.\nIt only included forcible male penile penetration of female vagina.\nThe new definition is: \u201cThe penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\u201d\nFor the first time ever, the new definition includes any gender of victim and perpetrator, not just women being raped by men.\nIt also recognizes that rape with an object can be as traumatic as penile/vaginal rape.\nThis definition also includes instances in which the victim is unable to give consent because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.\nFurthermore, because many rapes are facilitated by drugs or alcohol, the new definition recognizes that victim can be incapacitated and thus unable to consent because of ingestion of drugs or alcohol.\nSimilarly, victim may be legally incapable of consent because of age.\nThe ability of the victim to give consent must be determined in accordance with individual state statutes.\nPhysical resistance is not required on the part of the victim to demonstrate lack of consent.\nThe UCR is the national \u201creport card\u201d on serious crime; what gets reported through the UCR is how we, collectively, view crime in this country.\nPolice departments submit data on reported crimes and arrests to the UCR SRS.\nEven though most states have more expansive definitions of rape in their criminal codes, they had to report the smaller number of crimes falling under the more narrow UCR SRS definition.\nThis meant that the statistics that were reported nationally were both inaccurate and undercounted.\nBecause the new definition is more inclusive, reported crimes of rape are likely to increase.\nThis does not mean that rape has increased, but simply that it is more accurately reported.\nIn addition, the UCR program will also collect data based on the historical definition of rape, enabling law enforcement to track consistent trend data until the statistical differences between the old and new definitions are more fully understood.\nThe new UCR SRS definition of rape does not change Federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the Federal, State or local level, it simply means that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.\nThe Office of Violence Against Women OVW worked closely with White House Advisor on Violence Against Women Lynn Rosenthal and the Office of the Vice President, as well as multiple DOJ divisions, to modernize the definition.\nThe change was supported by external partners such as the National Sheriffs Association, National Association of Police Organizations, International Association of Chiefs of Police, Major City Chiefs, Major County Sheriffs, and the Police Executive Research Forum.\nFor more information about the Office on Violence Against Women, visitovw.usdoj.gov.\nWe remind all those in need of assistance, or other concerned friends and individuals, to call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE or the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE.
