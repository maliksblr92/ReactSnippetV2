Social Issues Sociology Society Family kinship Written By: The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica See Article History Family group of persons united by the ties of marriage, blood, or adoption, constituting single household and interacting with each other in their respective social positions, usually those of spouses, parents, children, and siblings.\nThe family group should be distinguished from household, which may include boarders and roomers sharing common residence.\nIt should also be differentiated from kindred which also concerns blood lines because kindred may be divided into several households.\nFrequently the family is not differentiated from the marriage pair, but the essence of the family group is the parent-child relationship, which may be absent from many marriage pairs.\nRead More on This Topic Christianity: Church and family The Christian understanding of sexuality, marriage, and family has been strongly influenced by the Old Testament view of marriage as an\u2026 At its most basic, then, family consists of an adult and his or her offspring.\nMost commonly, it consists of two married adults, usually man and woman almost always from different lineages and not related by blood along with their offspring, usually living in private and separate dwelling.\nThis type of unit, more specifically known as nuclear family, is believed to be the oldest of the various types of families in existence.\nSometimes the family includes not only the parents and their unmarried children living at home but also children that have married, their spouses, and their offspring, and possibly elderly dependents as well; such an arrangement is called an extended family.\nSocioeconomic aspects of the family At its best, the family performs various valuable functions for its members.\nPerhaps most important of all, it provides for emotional and psychological security, particularly through the warmth, love, and companionship that living together generates between spouses and in turn between them and their children.\nThe family also provides valuable social and political function by institutionalizing procreation and by providing guidelines for the regulation of sexual conduct.\nThe family additionally provides such other socially beneficial functions as the rearing and socialization of children, along with such humanitarian activities as caring for its members when they are sick or disabled.\nOn the economic side, the family provides food, shelter, clothing, and physical security for its members, some of whom may be too young or too old to provide for the basic necessities of life themselves.\nFinally, on the social side, the family may serve to promote order and stability within society as whole.\nHistorically, in most cultures, the family was patriarchal, or male-dominated.\nPerhaps the most striking example of the male-dominated family is the description of the family given in the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament where the male heads of the clans were allowed to have several wives as well as concubines.\nAs general rule, women had rather low status.\nIn Roman times the family was still patriarchal, but polygamy was not practiced, and in general the status of women was somewhat improved over that suggested in the Hebrew Bible, although they still were not allowed to manage their own affairs.\nThe Roman family was an extended one.\nThe family as it existed in medieval Europe was male-dominated and extended.\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription.\nSubscribe today In the West, industrialization and the accompanying urbanization spawned\u2014and continue to spawn\u2014many changes in family structure by causing sharp change in life and occupational styles.\nMany people, particularly unmarried youths, left farms and went to urban centres to become industrial workers.\nThis process led to the dissolution of many extended families.\nThe modern family that emerged after the Industrial Revolution is different from the earlier model.\nFor instance, patriarchal rule began to give way to greater equality between the sexes.\nSimilarly, family roles once considered exclusively male or female broke down.\nCaring for the home and children, once the exclusive duty of the female, is often shared activity, as, increasingly, is the earning of wages and the pursuit of public life, once the exclusive domain of the male.\nThe structure of the family is also changing in that some couples choose not to marry legally and instead elect to have their children out of wedlock; many of these informal relationships tend to be of short duration, and this\u2014as well as the rise in levels of divorce\u2014has led to rapid increase in the number of one-parent households.\nEspecially in Western cultures, the modern family is today more of consuming as opposed to producing unit, and the members of the family work away from home rather than at home.\nPublic authorities, primarily governmental ones, have assumed many of the functions that the family used to provide, such as caring for the aged and the sick, educating the young, and providing for recreation.\nTechnological advancements have made it possible for couples to decide if and when they want to have children.\nFamily law Family law varies from culture to culture, but in its broadest application it defines the legal relationships among family members as well as the relationships between families and society at large.\nSome of the important questions dealt with in family law include the terms and parameters of marriage, the status of children, and the succession of property from one generation to the next.\nIn nearly every case, family law represents delicate balance between the interests of society and the protection of individual rights.\nThe general rule in marriages until modern times was the legal transfer of dependency, that of the bride, from father to groom.\nNot only did the groom assume guardianship, he usually assumed control over all of his wife\u2019s affairs.\nOften, the woman lost any legal identity through marriage, as was the case in English common law.\nThere have been exceptions to this practice.\nMuslim women, for instance, had considerable control over their own personal property.\nThe use of dowries, an amount of money or property given to the husband with the bride in compensation for her dependency, has long been practiced in many countries, but it has tended to disappear in many industrial societies.\nIn general, modern marriage is best-described as voluntary union, usually between man and woman although there are still vestiges of the arranged marriage that once flourished in eastern Europe and Asia The emancipation of women in the 19th and 20th centuries changed marriage dramatically, particularly in connection with property and economic status.\nBy the mid-20th century, most Western countries had enacted legislation establishing equality between spouses.\nSimilarly changed is the concept of economic maintenance, which traditionally fell on the shoulders of the husband.\nThough many laws still lean toward this view, there was increasing recognition of woman\u2019s potential to contribute to the support of the family.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, family law and the notion of family itself was further complicated by calls for acceptance of same-sex marriages and nontraditional families.\nDissolution of marriages is one of the areas in which laws must try to balance private and public interest, since realistically it is the couple itself that can best decide whether its marriage is viable.\nIn many older systems\u2014e.g., Roman, Muslim, Jewish, Chinese, and Japanese\u2014some form of unilateral divorce was possible, requiring only one party to give notice of the intention, usually the male.\nMost modern systems recognize mutual request for divorce, though many require an attempt to reconcile before granting divorce.\nExtreme circumstances, in which blatant neglect, abuse, misbehaviour, or incapacity can be demonstrated, find resolution in civil court.\nMany systems favour special family courts that attempt to deal more fairly with sensitive issues such as custody of children.\nThe issue of children poses special problems for family law.\nIn nearly every culture, the welfare of children was formerly left to the parents entirely, and this usually meant the father.\nMost societies have come to recognize the general benefit of protecting children\u2019s rights and of prescribing certain standards of rearing.\nThus, more than in any other area, family law intervenes in private lives with regard to children.\nCompulsory education is an example of the law superseding parental authority.\nIn the case of single-parent homes, the law will frequently provide some form of support.\nLegislation on child labour and child abuse also asserts society\u2019s responsibility for child\u2019s best interests.\nThe succession of family interests upon the death of its members can be considered part of family law.\nMost legal systems have some means of dealing with division of property left by deceased family member.\nThe will, or testament, specifies the decedent\u2019s wishes as to such distribution, but surviving spouse or offspring may contest what appear to be unreasonable or inequitable provisions.\nThere are also laws that recognize family claims in the event that property is left intestate i.e., with no will to determine its distribution This article was most recently revised and updated by J.E.\nLuebering, Executive Editorial Director.\nLearn More in these related Britannica articles: Christianity: Church and family The
