In 1993, the General Assembly decided in resolution A/RES/47/237 that 15 May of every year should be observed as The International Day of Families. This day provides an opportunity to promote awareness of issues relating to families and to increase the knowledge of the social, economic and demographic processes affecting families.\nOn 25 September 2015, the 193 member states of the United Nations unanimously adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, set of 17 goals aiming to eliminate poverty, discrimination, abuse and preventable deaths, address environmental destruction, and usher in an era of development for all people, everywhere.\nFamilies and family-oriented policies and programmes are vital for the achievement of many of these goals.\nDid you know?\nMaternity leave, which was offered in 89% of countries in 1995, was available in 96% of countries by 2015.\nOnly 57% of women, who are married, or in domestic union, are able to make decisions about sexual relations and the use of contraceptives and reproductive health services.\nFamily homelessness is on the rise.\nIn some European countries, it has been consistently above 20% of the total homeless population.\nRelated links UN Reports and Resolutions on Family Workers with Family Responsibilities Convention Maternity Protection Convention Equal Remuneration Convention Maternity Protection Convention Revised Discrimination Employment and Occupation Convention Workplace Solutions For Childcare Reconciling Work And Family Responsibilities.\nPractical Ideas From Global Experience UN Events Online Webinar on 15 May, 2020 As UN Headquarters in New York remains closed for the month of May due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual observance of the International Day of Families will be conducted on-line.\nRegistration is required.\nFor further information, including the link to registration email Renata Kaczmarska at kaczmarska@un.org.\nPast Events 2019: \u201cFamilies and Climate Action: Focus on SDG13\u201d 2018: \u201cFamilies and inclusive societies\u201d 2017: \u201cFamilies, education and well-being\u201d 2016: \u201cFamilies, healthy lives and sustainable future\u201d 2015: \u201dMen in charge?\nGender equality and children\u2019s rights in contemporary families\u201d Other past events Could families be the key to achieving the SDGs?\nFamily policies are mainstay of national public policies, and the most meaningful vehicle for governments to influence the living standards of upcoming generations.\nAs part of achieving the global ambitions of the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs family policies play an important part in meeting targets across many of the goals.\nRelated observances The International Year of the Family 1994 International Day of Older Persons Global Day of Parents International Day of Family Remittances International Widows' Day World Children's Day International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women Why do we mark International Days?\nInternational days are occasions to educate the public on issues of concern, to mobilize political will and resources to address global problems, and to celebrate and reinforce achievements of humanity.\nThe existence of international days predates the establishment of the United Nations, but the UN has embraced them as powerful advocacy tool.\nWe also mark other UN observances.\nUnited Nations Donate A-Z Site Index Contact Copyright FAQ Fraud Alert Privacy Notice Terms of Use\n"}
