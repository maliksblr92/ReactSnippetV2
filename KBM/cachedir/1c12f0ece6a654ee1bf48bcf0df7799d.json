The present crisis, he explained, was new and terrifying threat to the young democracy: the Illuminati.\nFears of the secret society had been growing for the past year, and Dwight now warned the \u201cultimate objects\u201d of this group were nothing less than \u201cthe overthrow of religion, government, and human society civil and domestic.\nThese they pronounce to be so good, that murder, butchery and war, however extended and dreadful, are declared by them to be completely justifiable, if necessary for these great purposes.\u201d\nDwight, Federalist, was hardly alone.\nAmong the others sounding the alarm on the Illuminati were other well-known Federalists, including his brother, Theodore, prominent lawyer, and pastor and geographer Jedidiah Morse known as the \u201cfather of American geography,\u201d as well as the father of telegraph inventor Samuel Morse who authored sermon in 1798 warning that the Illuminati sought to \u201croot out and abolish Christianity, and overthrow all civil government.\u201d\nJedidiah Morse\u2019s text, in turn, received supportive letters from both George Washington and former chief justice and governor of New York John Jay for his efforts in bringing light to the subject.\nAdvertisement Morse, the Dwight brothers, and their allies were soon mobilizing opposition against Republican candidate Thomas Jefferson, calling him the candidate of none other than the Illuminati.\nBut they couldn\u2019t have anticipated what came next: Their conspiracy theory, once unleashed in the world, was turned back on them upending the 1800 election and demonstrating the unique vulnerability of American democracy to conspiracy theories\u2014especially during times of pitched cultural and ideological warfare.\nConspiracy theories will almost surely play role in the 2020 presidential election\u2014look no further than those that thrived in the immediate aftermath of the bungled Iowa caucuses and those that are now either causing panic or threatening to undo coordinated public response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.\nOne recent text message convinced untold numbers of people across the country that the president was just hours away from shutting down all businesses, including grocery stores\u2014a story that spread like wildfire without support from any mainstream news or government source.\nThe promulgation of conspiracy theories can feel new\u2014a by-product of social media, Russian disinformation campaigns and demagogic president who built political identity on birtherism.\nBut from almost the beginning of American democracy, wild, unproven theories have flourished, often even coming to be embraced by influential leaders.\nAnd the 1800 election shows just how those theories thrive and can even shift elections, long before Twitter, fake news and viral text messages.\nWhere did Dwight and his contemporaries get their ideas about the Illuminati?\nThe real Illuminati was founded by disgruntled Bavarian Jesuit named Adam Weishaupt.\nprofessor of canon law at the University of Ingolstadt, Weishaupt had become disillusioned with the Catholic Church by 1776.\nBelieving that only secret society could spread secular, rationalist ideas in repressive, religious environment, he founded small group modeled on the Freemasons, with which he hoped to someday found new society altogether, based on rational government free from religious influence.\nWeishaupt recruited young noblemen for his new group, seeking acolytes both rich and impressionable; gradually, the group expanded from few dozen to several thousands.\nIn 1784, Charles Theodore, the Duke of Bavaria, banned all secret societies, hoping to suppress the Illuminati specifically.\nTwo years after that, his police conducted raids on the houses of several high-profile members, confiscating essays deemed heretical that defended atheism and suicide, promoted counterfeiting and abortion, sketched out plans to include women and claimed the Illuminati had power over life and death.\nSunlight proved powerful disinfectant, and, once illuminated, the Illuminati dissolved.\nWeishaupt\u2019s organization might have been entirely lost to history as minor footnote if not for French priest named Augustin Barruel, who in 1797 tried to make sense of how his country had gone from seemingly stable Catholic monarchy to violent, atheist regime in such short time.\nHow had the ideas of philosophers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who had long railed against the excesses of the monarchy and the church, so successfully undermined the old order?\nBarruel concluded that they\u2019d relied on secret network of the Illuminati, who used unwitting Freemasons to spread its unholy message.\nBarruel\u2019s conspiracy theory posited that the entire French Revolution was not story of exuberant democracy descending into unpredictable chaos but rather carefully orchestrated plan by philosophers who\u2019d long seeded the French landscape with subversive agents, function of what Barruel termed \u201cthe Illuminization of Freemasonry\u201d: the union of Masonic secrecy and secular revolution.\nThough the Bavarian Illuminati may have been dead by the mid-1780s, Barruel\u2019s insinuation gave it new life.\nWhispers of these dangerous atheists found their way first to England with the publication of John Robison\u2019s 1797 pamphlet, Proofs of Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe Carried on in the Secret Meetings of the Freemasons, Illuminati, and Reading Societies.\nFreemason himself, Robison worried the irreligious Illuminati had gained control of the Masonic organization and perverted it and was now working to root \u201cout all the religious establishments, and overturning all the existing governments of Europe.\u201d\nRobison\u2019s warnings of the Illuminati reached the United States at vulnerable time.\nStill forming their more perfect union, Americans felt acutely vulnerable to foreign interference.\nBut by the late 1790s, this anxiety had broken along partisan lines.\nFederalists feared that France\u2019s revolutionaries were bent on turning Americans against their nascent government, whereas Jeffersonian Republicans worried instead that Great Britain was scheming to reclaim its former colonies.\nThe New England of Federalists like Dwight was in particular primed to receive news of godless network of spies and invaders.\nCalvinist remnants of the original Puritans including Congregationalists and Presbyterians still dominated New England politics, and they were wary of any attempt to separate church and state.\nThey supported their man John Adams for reelection against the Republican Thomas Jefferson, Deist who at times seemed to verge into atheism.\nWhile Jefferson believed Jesus Christ to be an enlightened prophet, he famously dismissed both the Resurrection and the miracles of the Gospels as mythology.\nThis, combined with his generally positive attitude toward post- Revolution France, made him likely candidate for Illuminati subversion.\nThat July Fourth, Dwight\u2019s brother, Theodore, proclaimed, \u201cI know not who belonged to that Society in this country, but if were about to make proselytes to illumatism in the United States, should in the first place apply to Thomas Jefferson, Albert Gallatin U.S. House Representative from Pennsylvania and future Treasury secretary under Jefferson and their political associates.\u201d\nBut having worked to stoke the public\u2019s fear of the Illuminati\u2019s infiltration of the United States, the Federalists were perhaps not prepared for how quickly this paranoia would be turned against them.\nHad they known, they would have perhaps been kinder to man named John C. Ogden.\nlittle-known and long-forgotten preacher, Ogden, had tried for years to establish himself in New England but repeatedly spoke out against what he saw as the entrenched power structure of the Congregationalist clergy, and in 1793, he left New England for New York and Philadelphia.\nEmbittered, he began publishing series of anonymous articles in the anti-Federalist Philadelphia paper, the Aurora, published by William Duane, who would go on to become powerful lawmaker in Pennsylvania and secretary of the Treasury under President Andrew Jackson.\nOgden\u2019s series was about conspiracy he claimed to have uncovered.\nThe New England of Morse and the Dwight brothers may have been publicly against Illumatism, Ogden argued, but this was all front: They were in fact secret Illuminati, and it was they \u2014not Thomas Jefferson\u2014who were bent on destroying America\u2019s young democracy.\nOgden achieved this reversal by turning his sights on Timothy Dwight, whom he began calling the \u201cPope of New England,\u201d insinuating that he was using his position at the head of Yale to infiltrate America\u2019s higher education system and indoctrinate the youth.\nLong before the modern, right-wing attack on \u201cliberal college professors,\u201d Ogden was accusing Dwight of \u201cpervert ing public literary institution to the purposes of party; and wish ing to extend the effect and oppression of ecclesiastical establishment through this nation,\u201d slyly insinuating that colleges were subversive breeding grounds where impressionable young people were being led astray.\nBy November of 1799, Ogden had stepped up his attacks and shifted from anti- Catholic to anti-Illuminati rhetoric.\nBehind this structure of anti-democratic indoctrination, he alleged, was sinister cabal bent on suppressing the freedom of religion in favor of an overt hierarchy, with New England Federalists in charge.\nHe played off of Americans\u2019 inherent distrust of anything that looked like pope and then blurred it with the conspiracy theories Dwight and Morse had already set in motion.\nNew England\u2019s Congregationalist clergy, Ogden argued, \u201cbear too near an affinity to the Illuminati Societies of Europe, not to be viewed part of the same: at least if Professor Robeson and Abbe Barruel are to be believed, they must be sister societies. What mattered, he understood, was simply the insinuation that there was power structure behind the scenes pulling the strings.\nThe bugbear of the Illuminati worked to unite series of interlinked partisan attacks: The Federalists advocated top-down hierarchy, they opposed religious and civic freedom and their love of democracy was insincere.\nAnd by alleging that these motives were deliberately obscured by this secret society, Ogden and the Aurora defused any potential defenses.\nOf course Dwight would speak out against the Illuminati, they argued; the more fervently he and other Federalists spoke out against them, the clearer it was that they were secretly members, trying to throw everyone off the scent.\nOgden understood that the Illuminati could represent something far more primal than simply atheism.\nSecret societies were terrifying because they presupposed group of foreign invaders whose motives could never be fully known.\nIt was easy to paint the tight-knit structure of New England politics as mostly secret enterprise controlled by few wealthy, well-connected individuals.\nOgden\u2019s conspiratorial accusations were carried not just by the Aurora but spread in sympathetic newspapers from New York to Baltimore.\nEven some who did not repeat his specific Illuminati insinuations adopted his overall contempt of New England\u2019s political class\u2014the Richmond, Virginia, Examiner called Connecticut \u201cPriest Ridden\u201d and \u201cmuzzled by its prejudices.\u201d\nAt Republican gatherings throughout the country, members toasted not just Jefferson but Aurora editor Duane for \u201chis endeavors to unveil the secret plots of crafty aristocracy\u201d and to the \u201cClerical Illuminati of New- England\u201d: \u201cMay their ambitious views in forming union between church and state, never be realized.\u201d\nWhile Dwight had first seized on the Illuminati as threat to religion, Ogden and the Aurora had recast it as the unholy union of secret state religion and the levers of government.\nOgden had helped manufacture paranoia around organized religion in the early republic that helped doom Adams\u2019 reelection.\nIn the early days of the republic, each state determined its own election day, so voting for the 1800 presidential election lasted from April until October.\nBy the time voting was over, Jefferson had won, though Ogden was not alive to see it\u2014he died in late September.\nBut his work had been done.\nDid Ogden\u2019s conspiratorial whisper campaign tip the scales?\nbitter, close- fought election, there were too many factors at play to say how crucial the Aurora\u2019s part was in all of this.\nBut the Aurora\u2019s Illuminati attacks were successful in part because they worked in tandem with mainstream assaults against Adams\u2019 ham-handed attempt to wed government with religion.\nAfter he called for national day of fasting and prayer in 1799, opponents accused him of trying to instill Presbyterianism as single, dominant religion, stoking fears of government-mandated faith.\nYears later, he would complain bitterly to Benjamin Rush of general suspicion \u201cthat the Presbyterian Church was ambitious and aimed at an establishment as national church.\nwas represented as Presbyterian and at the head of this political and ecclesiastical project.\nThe secret whisper ran through all the sects, \u2018Let us have Jefferson, Madison, Burr, anybody, whether they be philosophers, Deists, or even atheists, rather than Presbyterian President.\u2019\nNothing is more dreaded than the national government meddling with religion.\u201d\nAnd in doing so, Ogden revealed crucial lesson about democracy: paranoia, once unleashed, is impossible to control, and remarkably easy to turn back upon its source.\nIn his 1964 essay The Paranoid Style in American Politics Richard Hofstadter posited that American democracy was uniquely prone to conspiracy theories.\nBut what Hofstadter got wrong more than anything was his belief that such conspiracy theories are fringe part of American democracy.\nHe believed, ultimately, that \u201cresponsible elite with political and moral autonomy\u201d could curtail these excesses of belief, quarantining them at the fringes of culture.\nBut Dwight, Morse and their colleagues were never fringe actors, nor was the Philadelphia Aurora minor publication.\nOver two centuries later, conspiracy theories once again come not from the fringes but from media juggernauts like Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting\u2014and from the president of the United States and his allies.\nAmerican citizens need facts and for media and social media companies to act responsibly, to be sure.\nBut we might also need to accept that democracy makes us all touch paranoid and to be on guard for how it affects not just our fellow citizens but ourselves, too.\nFiled Under: Thomas Jefferson, Conspiracy Theories, History Dept.\nShow Comments POLITICO Facebook Twitter Link Link Copied More Mail Reddit WhatsApp About Us Advertising Breaking News Alerts Careers Credit Card Payments Digital Edition FAQ Feedback Headlines Photos POWERJobs Press Print Subscriptions Write For Us RSS Site Map Terms of Service Privacy Policy Do not sell my info (C) 2020 POLITICO LLC\n"}
