Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources.\nUnsourced material may be challenged and removed.\nThese rapes have characteristics beyond those found in rape by individuals; for example, gang rapists tend to be younger and serial in their crimes, the gang is more often under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\nGang rapes are more violent; the sexual and non-sexual injuries to the victim are often far more severe.\nLess than one in three gang rapes are reported, while less than in 20 attempted but failed gang rapes are reported.[1] Group-think criminal spiral edit Gang rape can be seen as an example of group criminal spin.\nAccordingly, group of individuals may perform an initial behavior that proceeds in criminal direction far beyond the initial intention of its participants.\nWithin this process, each group member contributes certain role towards the development of the criminal spin\u2014even the passive members, who are silent participants, support the spin by their very presence.\nIt is considered group criminal spin because the most gang members perform this act only during group interaction, \"letting themselves\" deviate from their everyday norms.\nIn the same way, group interaction may display an \"I must\" motive, thus social forces within the group directs it towards raping.\nIn such process of an acute group spin, the group operates as whole that is larger than its parts.[22] Even if its individual members would not have committed the rape, their collective spin leads to an extreme escalation of violence.\nAssociated factors in the crime included alcohol misuse, poverty, personal history of childhood victimization, need to prove heterosexual performance, dominance over women, and participation in gangs and related activities.\nMost cases were not reported to law enforcement, and just 23% of single or multiple perpetrator rapes that were reported by the victims ended in prison sentence.[6] The 1886 Mount Rennie rape case in Sydney in Australia falls in this category.\nSydney gang rapes, series of gang rape attacks committed by group of up to fourteen Lebanese Australian youths in Sydney in 2000.\nThese would result in pregnancies, terminations, miscarriages, babies raised by their mothers, and babies removed, causing further trauma.\nThose impregnated included girls as young as 12.[39] Saudi Arabia edit Qatif rape case, woman was raped by seven men.\nThe case brought attention because the victim was sentenced under Sharia law to be lashed.\nSaudi Rape Case Spurs Calls for Reform In NYtimes.\n35% of those who have committed gang rapes against women have also committed additional rapes where the victim was man.\nThe motives of rape included combination of reasons.\nMarch 2015 ---|--- Gang rape, or estupro coletivo is prevalent in Brazil.\nAbout 36% of the perpetrators had raped more than one woman, 50% of those who had committed gang rape had raped both partner as single perpetrator as well as non-partner during gang rape, while 32% had gang raped woman and raped man.\nThe study also found that 90% of the rapists were in the 15\u201329 age group at the time they perpetrated the first rape.[6] In July 2013, the son of Chinese general was charged with four other men to being part of gang rape.\nOne witness described 50 boys \"queuing\" to rape her.[62] 10 of the 14 defendants who were minors at the time of gang rape were acquitted, while the remaining adults found guilty were given to 12 months in prison.\nAbout 52% of the perpetrators had raped more than one woman, 64% of those who had committed gang rape had raped both partner as single perpetrator as well as non-partner during gang rape, while 12% had gang raped woman and raped man.\nThe study also found that 90% of the rapists in Indonesia were in the 15\u201329 age group when they committed their first rape.[6] Iran edit Many incidents of gang rapes have been reported in Iran.\nAbout 52% of these victims were less than 16 years old.[80] Like other nations, Malaysia does not segregate rape and gang rape cases.\nTrans women are not immune.\n44% of these perpetrators had raped more than woman over their lifetime.[6] In Papua New Guinea, 25% of the first rape was committed at juvenile age less than 15, while in 70% of the cases the perpetrator's age was 15\u201329 at the time of first crime.\nSaudi Arabia edit Further information: Rape in Saudi Arabia The Qatif rape case was 2006 gang rape of teenage girl by seven men.\nBetween 10% to 33% of all rapes are gang rapes involving three or more people.\nThis led to widespread protests.\nTheir average age was 21 and 13 were under the age of 18 when the crime was committed.\nOf the convicted, 40 out of the 43 were either immigrants born abroad or born in Sweden to immigrant parents.[113] Another investigation by newspaper Aftonbladet found that of 112 men and boys convicted for gang rape since July 2012, 82 were born outside Europe.\nThe median age of the victims was 15, while out of 10 perpetrators were between 15 and 20.[114] United Arab Emirates edit In several cases in 2013, the courts of the UAE have sentenced the gang raped woman to prison under its laws.\nThe authorities demanded that the tourist confess he is gay and that he asked for sex.\nBaker said the government had set up network of more than 70 people with experience of dealing with gangs to work with 33 of the worst affected areas of the country, including 20 in London.\nIn one case cited by the CSJ report, schoolgirl was abducted and sexually assaulted by nine males because she criticised gang member.\nThe report found that girls as young as eight were being used to carry drugs while female gang members in their teens were being pressured to have sex with boys as young as 10 to initiate males into gangs.\nSee also edit Types of rape References edit 1.\nUllman, S.
