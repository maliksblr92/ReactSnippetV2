Share the hard reality.\nThere\u2019s little benefit for latter generations in hearing the founder\u2019s story if you gloss over the hardships, the struggle, and the failures that came before the glory.\nIf the next generation wants to make their own success, they deserve to hear the gritty truth.\nRather than raising the founder\u2019s legacy to mythical proportions, humanize them, perhaps by describing time when they had to go without during particularly tumultuous period for the business, so that the next generation can relate to and learn from the founder\u2019s experience.\nDining table conversations are some of the most valuable opportunities business families have to exchange ideas with each other.\nAnd certainly dining table conversations or Zoom conference calls about how your family business is navigating the extraordinary current challenges can be valuable tutorial.\nThe family members leading the business should talk with the next generation about what\u2019s hard, how you are making decisions, and what doesn\u2019t go well.\nYou are providing your next generation with real-time case study about how the current generation is managing crisis and how your family business will survive.\n2\\. Test for viability.\nIndulging every half-baked idea that budding entrepreneur has will not help them or the business in the long run.\nWe\u2019ve found that financial support can be as much detriment as it is an advantage to young entrepreneur if it\u2019s too readily available from family coffers.\nHaving easy access to funds, without strict conditions, can make those funds seem like play money.\nInstead of immediately defaulting to financial support, offer your next generation the family\u2019s collective wisdom first.\nAsk smart questions and require well thought-out answers submitted through clear process with appropriate deadlines.\nHold ideas up to \u201cpublic standard\u201d to see if they could attract outside interest.\nAnd if appropriate, have these would-be entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to outside venture capital firms for the experience, if nothing else.\nIf it\u2019s business idea only mother could love, then ask the entrepreneur to further develop it before pulling out the family checkbook.\nIf the idea has merit, then by all means, proceed, but at least your budding entrepreneur will have worked hard to demonstrate the value proposition not least to themselves first.\n3\\. Offer benefits beyond money.\nConsider what \u201cextra benefits\u201d you can offer that your rising entrepreneur may not be able to get elsewhere.\nMoney can come from multiple sources, from institutions to private funding.\nIf an idea is good enough, there will be no shortage of financial backers trying to stake claim.\nAs business family, you\u2019re in the unique position to offer more than just money.\nCould your head of strategy act as mentor as your entrepreneur develops their business plan?\nCould you offer connections to help with marketing, supply chain, or distribution?\nCould you structure financing as loan so that the entrepreneur doesn\u2019t have to surrender large chunk of shares?\n4\\. Establish mutual ground rules before you need them.\nWhether you elect to set aside financial fund to support family entrepreneurial dreams or informally provide access to family money, it\u2019s critical to establish clear guidelines for what support will be provided.\n5\\. Support aspiring entrepreneurs who want to flourish on their own.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to let promising talent venture outside the family business.\nThey could learn skills and lessons on the outside that they can later apply within the legacy business either in an operational role, as board director, or as an active shareholder.\nAnd the potential upside for revolutionary new idea or business and the personal satisfaction and fulfillment your family member will get from doing it is limitless.\nConsider the next generation striking out on their own as sign that you have succeeded in instilling an entrepreneurial drive.\n6\\. Give \u201cboosts\u201d without micromanaging.\nOne of the biggest challenges for successful entrepreneurs who have built tremendous businesses is how to mentor their next generation without taking over.\nHow do you balance giving the next generation enough guidance so that they can learn from your mistakes but not so much that they dismiss all advice outright?\nConsider establishing policy for yourself about the topics on which you will provide unsolicited advice, and those where you will not.\nDone effectively, transfer of knowledge can carve years off of new business\u2019s development time and increase its likelihood of success.\nDone poorly, it can damage family relations if both sides are not clear on what would be valued and well-received.\n7\\. Give an intrapreneur some breathing room.\nSome of the best visionaries we know made their mark within an existing family business.\nBecause they have the benefit of learning the lessons from the generation before them, they\u2019re able to capitalize on that advantage by applying it to evolving market trends putting the business at the forefront of new market.\nIf you have promising intrapreneur, make sure to give them room to test out their ideas, to learn, and to grow even if it\u2019s not exactly how you would do it personally.\nNext generation intrapreneurs are often reacting to different market cues than what worked in prior generations.\nStoke their talent and interests.\nIt will ultimately be boon to the family business if the next generation is engaged, driven, hungry, and enabled to create something of their own.\nThese principles highlight how important it is to find the balance between offering wisdom and dictating how something must be done so that you stoke the next generation\u2019s entrepreneurial fire.\nNo matter how great the founding idea or business is, it cannot last indefinitely.\nBusiness families need fresh infusions of entrepreneurial drive and passion to adapt to changing environments, so they continue to thrive.\nAnd individuals need to test their own mettle and be driven to succeed on their own for their own sense of self- worth.\nPerhaps most importantly, don\u2019t be afraid to fail.\nFailure is only tragedy if it\u2019s destination rather than step along the journey.\nAs tempting as it may be to have safety net always in place, it can be more of hindrance than benefit to individual development and entrepreneurial drive in the long-term.\nAllow your next generation the space to take risks, to fall down, to fail.\nAnd if failure does occur, encourage them to learn from their mistakes, to recover, and to chart new course.\nFor one seasoned entrepreneur we know, the idea of failure was as prized as the idea of success.\nHe put together collective fund for his six children to invest in entrepreneurial pursuits with no rules or strings, just \u201ctraining ground.\u201d\nThe next generation was astonished by the degree of trust he had in them.\nThey promptly divvied up the fund into seven equal shares, one for each of them and the last for joint venture later.\nAbsent any structure or guidance, each stumbled in their own entrepreneurial attempt, all of which differed wildly space rockets, surgical robots, brew pub, and commercial real estate, to name few Instead of getting mad when his children sheepishly reported their losses, the father asked what they learned in the process.\nOnce the siblings peeled apart the lessons they learned individually, their combined experience led them to invest what was left in the fund in an innovative medical device, which turned out to be success.\nBoth generations agreed that losing money was painful, but ultimately it was also the best investment they ever made because they learned how to fail, recover, and work together.\nThe experience and wisdom they gained navigating those hardships was worth its weight in gold, and has been especially useful during difficult economic times like the one we\u2019re having today.\nRemember, nothing about entrepreneurship is straightforward.\nThere is no prescribed formula or established way to develop something revolutionary.\nYour own family business legend will probably attest to that.\nWhile, as in our example above, your own road to success may be winding path, we hope these principles help you to always keep your north star cultivating entrepreneurial drive in sight.\nSome details have been disguised to protect confidentiality.
