"Rape From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search This article is about form of human sexual assault.\nFor rape among non-human animals, see Sexual coercion among animals.\nFor other uses, see Rape disambiguation Type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse without consent The Rape of Proserpina by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 1621-22, at the Galleria Borghese in Rome.\nThese practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes.\nRape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, targeted ethnic group.\nPeople who have been raped can be traumatized and develop posttraumatic stress disorder.[10] Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.\nIn Roman law, it or raptus was classified as form of crimen vis \"crime of assault\".[19][20] Raptus referred to the abduction of woman against the will of the man under whose authority she lived, and sexual intercourse was not necessary element.\nOther definitions of rape have changed over time.\nUntil 2012, the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI considered rape crime solely committed by men against women.\nThe previous definition, which had remained unchanged since 1927, was considered outdated and narrow.\nThe updated definition includes recognizing any gender of victim and perpetrator and that rape with an object can be as traumatic as penile/vaginal rape.\nThe bureau further describes instances when the victim is unable to give consent because of mental or physical incapacity.\nIt recognizes that victim can be incapacitated by drugs and alcohol and unable to give valid consent.\nThe definition does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the federal, state or local level; it rather means that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.[21][22] Health organizations and agencies have also expanded rape beyond traditional definitions.\nThe World Health Organization WHO defines rape as form of sexual assault,[23] while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC includes rape in their definition of sexual assault; they term rape form of sexual violence.\nIncidences of rape are classified into number of categories, and they may describe the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim and the context of the sexual assault.\nThese include date rape, gang rape, marital rape, incestual rape, child sexual abuse, prison rape, acquaintance rape, war rape and statutory rape.\nThis can lead to the presumption of consent.[35] Duress may be actual or threatened force or violence against the victim or someone close to the victim.\nEven blackmail may constitute duress.\nAbuse of power may constitute duress.\nIt is form of partner rape, domestic violence, and sexual abuse.\nOnce widely accepted or ignored by law, spousal rape is now denounced by international conventions and is increasingly criminalized.\nStill, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal, or is illegal but widely tolerated and accepted as husband's prerogative.\nIn 2006, the UN Secretary-General's In-depth study on all forms of violence against women stated that pg 113 \"Marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 states.\nOf these, 32 have made marital rape specific criminal offence, while the remaining 74 do not exempt marital rape from general rape provisions.\nMarital rape is not prosecutable offense in at least 53 States.\nFour States criminalize marital rape only when the spouses are judicially separated.\nSome may believe that when injuries are not visible, the woman must have consented.\nNo single facet explains the motivation for rape; the underlying motives of rapists can be multi-faceted.\nSeveral factors have been proposed: anger,[46] power,[47] sadism, sexual gratification, or evolutionary proclivities.[48][49] However, some factors have significant causal evidence supporting them.\nIn some areas in Papua New Guinea, women can be punished by public gang rape, usually through permission by elders.[55][ needs update Gang rape and mass rape are often used as means of male bonding.\nThis is particularly evident among soldiers, as gang rape accounts for about three quarters or more of war rape while gang rape accounts for less than quarter of rapes during peace time.\nCommanders push recruits to rape, as committing rape can be taboo and illegal and so builds loyalty among those involved.\nSome may remain in denial for years afterwards.[59][60] Confusion over whether or not their experience constitutes rape is typical, especially for victims of psychologically coerced rape.\nVictims may react in ways they did not anticipate.\nAfter the rape, they may be uncomfortable/frustrated with and not understand their reactions.[62][63] Most victims respond by 'freezing up' or becoming compliant and cooperative during the rape.\nThese are common survival responses of all mammals.[64] This can cause confusion for others and the person assaulted.\nAn assumption is that someone being raped would call for help or struggle.\nstruggle would result in torn clothes or injuries.[62] Dissociation can occur during the assault.[62] Memories may be fragmented especially immediately afterwards.\nThey may consolidate with time and sleep.[62] man or boy who is raped may be stimulated and even ejaculate during the experience of the rape.\nwoman or girl may orgasm during sexual assault.\nThis may become source of shame and confusion for those assaulted along with those who were around them.[65][66][67] Trauma symptoms may not show until years after the sexual assault occurred.\nUse of condom significantly reduces the likelihood of pregnancy and disease transmission, both to the victim and to the rapist.\nAcquiring AIDS through rape puts people risk of suffering psychological problems.\nAcquiring HIV through rape may lead to the in behaviors that create risk of injecting drugs.[75] Acquiring sexually transmitted infections increases the risk of acquiring HIV.[74] The belief that having sex with virgin can cure HIV/AIDS exists in parts of Africa.\nWomen who have been raped are sometimes deemed to have behaved improperly.\nThese include the idea that power is reserved to men whereas women are meant for sex and objectified, that women want forced sex and to be pushed around,[86] and that male sexual impulses and behaviors are uncontrollable and must be satisfied.[87] For females, victim-blaming correlates with fear.\nMany rape victims blame themselves.\nFemale jurors might look at the woman on the witness stand and believe she had done something to entice the defendant.[88] In Chinese culture, victim blaming often is associated with the crime of rape, as women are expected to resist rape using physical force.\nThis can be perpetrated by the rapist, friends, or relatives of the rapist.\nThe intent can be to prevent the victim from reporting the rape.\nOther reasons for threats against the those assaulted is to punish them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint.\nThe relatives of the person who has been raped may wish to prevent \"bringing shame\" to the family and may also threaten them.\nVictims are to be informed of this immediately by law enforcement or medical service providers.[91][92] Emergency rooms of many hospitals employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners SAN/FEs with specific training to care for those who have experienced rape or sexual assault.\nThey are able to conduct focused medical-legal exam.\nIf such trained clinician is not available, the emergency department has sexual assault protocol that has been established for treatment and the collection of evidence.[25][93] Staff are also trained to explain the examinations in detail, the documentation and the rights associated with the requirement for informed consent.\nThis general assessment will prioritize the treatment of injuries by the emergency room staff.\nMedical personnel involved are trained to assess and treat those assaulted or follow protocols established to ensure privacy and best treatment practices.\nThe presence of infection is determined by sampling of body fluids from the mouth, throat, vagina, perineum, and anus.[93] Forensic sampling Main article: Rape investigation Victims have the right to refuse any evidence collection.\nVictims advocates ensure the victims' wishes are respected by hospital staff.\nOnce the injuries of the patient have been treated and she or he is stabilized, the sample gathering will begin.\nStaff will encourage the presence of rape/sexual assault counselor to provide an advocate and reassurance.[99] During the medical exam, evidence of bodily secretions is assessed.\nDried semen that is on clothing and skin can be detected with fluorescent lamp.[93][100] Notes will be attached to those items on which semen has been found.\nThese specimens are marked, placed in paper bag,[101] and be marked for later analysis for the presence of seminal vesicle-specific antigen.[93][94] Though technically, medical staff are not part of the legal system, only trained medical personnel can obtain evidence that is admissible during trial.\nThe procedures have been standardized.\nEvidence is collected, signed, and locked in secure place to guarantee that legal evidence procedures are maintained.\nThis carefully monitored procedure of evidence collection and preservation is known as the chain of evidence.\nGenital injuries An internal pelvic exam is not recommended for sexually immature or prepubescent girls due to the probability that internal injuries do not exist in this age group.\nAn internal exam may be recommended if significant bloody discharge is observed, though.[93] complete pelvic exam for rape anal or vaginal is conducted.\nAn oral exam is done if there have been injuries to the mouth, teeth, gums or pharynx.\nThough the patient may have no complaints about genital pain signs of trauma can still be assessed.\nPrior to the complete bodily and genital exam, the patient is asked to undress, standing on white sheet that collects any debris that may be in the clothing.\nThe clothing and sheet are properly bagged and labeled along with other samples that can be removed from the body or clothing of the patient.\nSamples of fibers, mud, hair, leaves are gathered if present.\nSamples of fluids are collected to determine the presence of the perpetrator's saliva and semen that may be present in the patients mouth, vagina or rectum.\nIf foreign object was used during the assault, x-ray visualization will identify retained fragments.[109] Genital injuries are more prevalent in post-menopausal women and prepubescent girls.\nInternal injuries to the cervix and vagina can be visualized using colposcopy.\nUsing colposcopy has increased the detection of internal trauma from six percent to fifty-three percent.\nGenital injuries to children who have been raped or sexually assaulted differ in that the abuse may be on-going or it happened in the past after the injuries heal.\nScarring is one sign of the sexual abuse of children.[99] Several studies have explored the association between skin color and genital injury among rape victims.\nMany studies found difference in rape-related injury based on race, with more injuries being reported for white females and males than for black females and males.\nThis may be because the dark skin color of some victims obscures bruising.\nChlamydial and gonococcal infections in women are of particular concern due to the possibility of ascending infection.\nInformation regarding other treatment options are available from the CDC.[99] The transmission of HIV is frequently major concern of the patient.[102] Prophylactic treatment for HIV is not necessarily administered.\nRoutine treatment for HIV after rape or sexual assault is controversial due to the low risk of infection after one sexual assault.\nTransmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative anal sex is estimated to be 0.5 to 3.2 percent.\nTransmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative vaginal intercourse is 0.05 to 0.15 percent.\nRape shield laws protect the person who was raped and who has positive test results.\nThese laws prevent having such evidence used against someone who was raped.\nSomeone who was raped may be concerned that prior infection may suggest sexual promiscuity.\nThere may, however, be situations in which testing has the legal purpose, as in cases where the threat of transmission or actual transmission of an STI was part of the crime.\nProfessional counseling and on-going treatment by trained health care providers is often sought by the victim.[115] There are clinicians who are specially trained in the treatment of those who have experienced rape and sexual assault/abuse.\nTreatment can be lengthy and be challenging for both the counselor and the patient.\nSeveral treatment options exist and vary by accessibility, cost, or whether or not insurance coverage exists for the treatment.\nTreatment also varies dependent upon the expertise of the counselor\u2014some have more experience and or have specialized in the treatment of sexual trauma and rape.\nTo be the most effective, treatment plan should developed based upon the struggles of the patient and not necessarily based upon the traumatic experience.\nAn effective treatment plan will take the following into consideration: current stressors, coping skills, physical health, interpersonal conflicts, self-esteem, family issues, involvement of the guardian, and the presence of mental health symptoms.\n[115] The degree of success for emotional and psychiatric treatments is often dependent upon the terminology used in the treatment, i.e. redefining the event and experience.\nLabels used like rape victim and rape survivor to describe the new identities of women who have been raped suggest that the event is the dominant and controlling influence on her life.\nThese may have an effect on supportive personnel.\nThe consequences of using these labels needs to be assessed.[96] Positive outcomes of emotional and psychiatric treatment for rape exist; these can be an improved self-concept, the recognition of growth, and implementing new coping styles.[96] perpetrator found guilty by the court is often required to receive treatment.\nThere are many options for treatment, some more successful than others.[116] The psychological factors that motivated the convicted perpetrator are complex but treatment can still be effective.\ncounselor will typically evaluate disorders that are currently present in the offender.\nInvestigating the developmental background of the offender can help explain the origins of the abusive behavior occurred in the first place.\nEmotional and psychological treatment has the purpose of identifying predictors of recidivism, or the potential that the offender will commit rape again.\nIn some instances neurological abnormalities have been identified in the perpetrators, and in some cases they have themselves experienced past trauma.\nAdolescents and other children can be the perpetrators of rape, although this is uncommon.\nResearch on male-on-male and female-on-male rape is rare.\nFewer than one in ten male-male rapes are reported.\nAs group, males who have been raped by either gender often get little services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped to deal with this type of crime.\nInstances in which the perpetrator is female, are not clear and lead to the denial of women being sexual aggressors.\nThis could obscure the dimensions of the problem.\nFBI convicted sex offenders in 2012:[131] 78,500 male 4,394 female.\nThe researchers noted that much of these classifications were based on the personal judgments and biases of the police investigators and were made in violation of official criteria for establishing false allegation.\nThe researchers noted that where the police found case to be false allegation but didn't want to pursue charges against the accuser, they marked it as \"no further police action\" instead.\nOther studies have suggested that the rate of false allegations in America may be higher.\nAlthough what constituted this crime has varied by historical period and culture, the definitions tended to focus around an act of forced vaginal intercourse perpetrated through physical violence or imminent threat of death or severe bodily injury, by man, on woman or girl, not his wife.\nSexual penetration of male by another male fell under the legal domain of sodomy.\nRape laws existed to protect virginal daughters from rape.\nIn many cultures forced sex on prostitute, slave, war enemy, member of racial minority, etc., was not rape.[167] From the classical antiquity of Greece and Rome into the Colonial period, rape along with arson, treason and murder was capital offense.\n\"Those committing rape were subject to wide range of capital punishments that were seemingly brutal, frequently bloody, and at times spectacular.\"\nIn the 12th century, kinsmen of the victim were given the option of executing the punishment themselves.\nRoman laws allowed three distinct charges for the crime: stuprum unsanctioned sexual intercourse which, in the early times, also included adultery vis physical assault for purpose of lust; and iniuria general charge denoting any type of assault upon person.\nAforementioned Lex Iulia specifically criminalized per vim stuprum unsanctioned sexual intercourse by force.\nThe former two were public criminal charges which could be brought whenever the victim was woman or child of either gender, but only if the victim was freeborn Roman citizen ingenuus and carried potential sentence of death or exile.\nIniuria was civil charge that demanded monetary compensation, and had wider application for example, it could have been brought in case of sexual assault on slave by person other than their owner.\nAugustus Caesar enacted reforms for the crime of rape under the assault statute Lex Iulia de vi publica which bears his family name, Iulia.\nThe law known as Lex Scantinia covered at least some forms of male-on-male stuprum and Quintillian mentions fine of 10,000 sesterces about 10 years worth of Roman legionnaire's pay as normal penalty for stuprum upon an ingenuus.\nFrom 1935 to 1965, shift from labeling rapists as criminals to believing them to be mentally ill \"sexual psychopaths\" began making its way into popular opinion.\nBecause women were becoming more involved in the public i.e. searching for jobs rather than being housewife some people claimed that these women were \"loose\" and looking for trouble.\nIn the United States, before and during the American Civil War when chattel slavery was widespread, the law focused primarily on rape as it pertained to black men raping white women.\nThe penalty for such crime in many jurisdictions was death or castration.\nNow it will be considered war crime.\nWe want to send out strong message that rape is no longer trophy of war.\"[182] In Aydin Turkey the European Court of Human Rights ECHR ruled for the first time that rape amounts to torture, thus violating article of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nIt stated, \"Indeed, rapists often employ subtle coercion or bullying when this is sufficient to overcome their victims.\nIn most cases of rape against children, violence is not necessary to obtain submission.\nThe Mongols were said to have raped the surviving soldiers at the command of their leader.\nfemale Soviet war correspondent described what she had witnessed: \"The Russian soldiers were raping every German female from eight to eighty.\nIncluded in the latter figure are about 15,000 Jews, largely victims of executions by Hungarian Arrow Cross Party militia.\nWhen the Soviets finally claimed victory, they initiated an orgy of violence, including the wholesale theft of anything they could lay their hands on, random executions and mass rape.\n\"The worst suffering of the Hungarian population is due to the rape of women.\nRapes\u2014affecting all age groups from ten to seventy are so common that very few women in Hungary have been spared.\"\nSwiss embassy report cited in Ungv\u00e1ry 2005, p.350.\nKrisztian Ungvary The Siege of Budapest 2005 References 1.\n\"Sexual violence chapter 6\" PDF World Health
