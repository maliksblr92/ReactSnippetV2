The dog sprays Bella and Anthony with shrapnel that contains trackers, then climbs down and shoots Anthony dead.\nBella flees without the box to her car, with Clarke following in the van.\nThe dog jumps into the van, kills Clarke and pursues Bella.\nIt eventually enters her car, but she sends the car off cliff and escapes.\nBella uses pliers to extract the tracker embedded in her leg.\nOver her walkie- talkie, she asks someone to pass message to her loved ones in case she is killed.\nBella is chased by the dog into forest, climbing nearby tree.\nThe dog's arm was damaged when it escaped the car wreck, so it cannot climb the tree, and instead powers down and waits.\nBella drains it of power by repeatedly throwing sweets at it, causing it to power up and down.\nWhen the dog no longer responds, Bella climbs down.\nShe comes across compound and breaks in.\nBella takes car keys and shotgun from two rotting corpses in the bedroom.\nWhen the sun rises, the dog recharges and gains access to the compound.\nAs the dog approaches, Bella leaps out and throws paint over its visual sensor, then throws the paint can to the corner of the room to distract it and hurries to the car.\nHowever, the car will not start, so she turns on the radio and hides.\nAs the dog investigates the noise, Bella shoots it.\nThe dog stabs her in the leg; she shoots it again and it falls to the ground.\nThe dog releases final shell, showering Bella with tracker-embedded shrapnel.\nIn the bathroom mirror, Bella sees many trackers in her face.\nShe lifts knife, but notices tracker in her jugular vein.\nBella speaks into her walkie-talkie, unsure if she can be heard, saying goodbye to her loved ones.\nAs she puts the knife to her throat, the camera pans out over the landscape, showing dogs approaching and investigating.\nIn the warehouse, the box's contents\u2014dozens of teddy bears\u2014have spilled onto the floor.\nProduction edit The episode was inspired by robotics products like BigDog from Boston Dynamics.\nMaxine Peake stars in the episode as Bella.\nBrooker came up with the episode's central idea while watching videos of Boston Dynamics' robotics products such as BigDog.\nHe found that there was something \"creepy\" in how the products, if knocked over, would look helpless as they worked to regain their stance.\nVisual effects company DNEG were hired to work on this.[13] Filming edit Slade initially received the script in June 2016, while finishing work on the first series of American Gods.\nSlade was involved in Peake's casting, and had large amount of autonomy during filming.\nIn the scenes with Bella in car, remote driver controlled steering from pod on top of the car.\nThis allowed Peake to act fearfully with more realism.\nAt one point, dog jumps through car window and shoots the driver.\nBishop believed it is metaphor for economic inequality.[25] VanDerWerff suggested the scene evokes predator and prey imagery, comparing it to George Orwell's dystopia Animal Farm.[23] Reception edit The episode has received mostly positive reviews.\nClub for its \"clear and immediate stakes\" and threat which keeps the viewers interested.\n---|---|---|---|---|--- 2018 British Academy Television Craft Awards Special, Visual Effects Graphics Dneg TV, Jean-clement Soret, Russell McLean, Joel Collins Won [56] Visual Effects Society Awards Outstanding Animated Character in an Episode or Real-Time Project Steven Godfrey, Stafford Lawrence, Andrew Robertson, Lestyn Roberts Nominated [57] References edit 1.\nBirnbaum, Debra 25 September 2015 \"'Black Mirror' Lands at Netflix\".
