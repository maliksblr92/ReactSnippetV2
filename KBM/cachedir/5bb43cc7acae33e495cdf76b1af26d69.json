Still, the weirdest, most surprising thing about the nudity in the scene is the part viewers can't see: The crew was naked during filming, too.\n\"One cast member said they would only get naked if we did,\" Verhoeventold Empire.\n\"Well, my cinematographer was born in nudist colony and have no problem with taking my clothes off, so we did.\nIt is strange, but of course Americans get more upset

to get through the censors than body riddled with bullets.\"\n'Short Cuts' In Short Cuts Robert Altman's 1993 comedy-drama, audiences were surprised by controversial scene of waist-down nudity from Julianne Moore.\n\"People ask all the time if sex scenes and nudity are hard,\" the actress later said, reflecting on the nude scenes she's filmed during her career.\nNot the lines or the physicality, but the emotion.\"\n'Trainwreck' In Amy Schumer's 2015 rom-com Trainwreck John Cena stole the show as one of Amy's regular hookups.\nAfter one of the film's most hilarious sex scenes, Cena nearly bared all--save for what tiny washcloth could cover.\n'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' It's pretty standard to see nudity in an R-rated comedy.\nIn fact, we go in expecting raunchiness and least some nakedness at this point.\nBut because sexism, usually it's the women who strip down.\nSo when Jason Segel went full frontal in Forgetting Sarah Marshall jaws dropped.\n'Titanic' Titanic is one of the biggest moneymakers of all time--and the PG-13 rating certainly helped an rating limits film's audience and, thus, its earning potential But in spite of that family-friendly rating, Kate Winslet went topless for one of the most famous nude scenes ever.\n'The Big Lebowski' The Big Lebowski is one of the least predictable movies ever, and perhaps its least predictable moment might just be when Julianne Moore swings from the ceiling while fully nude.\nTo be fair, her character was making \"vaginal art.\"\n'Any Given Sunday' Oh hey, it's just Cameron Diaz, all business-like, walking into an NFL locker room.\nAnd then BAM Penis.\nSo much penis.\n'About Schmidt' There's nothing Kathy Bates can't do--including nail nude scene.\nHer nonchalant nakedness in About Schmidt's hot tub moment was completely amazing and completely surprising.\n'The Wolf of Wall Street' Paramount Pictures Jonah Hill famously wore prosthetic for his nude scene in The Wolf of Wall Street --but hey, if Martin

utterly shocking as the sex scene in Team America: World Police yes.\n'The Fifth Element' Another PG-13 movie that snuck in some light nudity: The Fifth Element shows fully naked Leeloo being born.\nTo be clear, we're obviously all born naked --just not all of us are born looking like 22-year-old Milla Jovovich.\n'The Whole Nine Yards' This movie is rated R, and it definitely earned its rating: Amanda Peet's unexpected gun-wielding nude scene is just one of the many scenes she steals.\n'Hackers' Angelina Jolie is currently one of the biggest stars in the world, but she was just 20-year-old up-and-comer when she very briefly bared her breast in this PG-13 movie.\n'Trading Places' Jamie Lee Curtis has starred in so many horror movies that she's earned the nickname \"Scream Queen.\"\nInterestingly, she never went nude in these films as Scream taught us, getting naked during scary movie ensures you're in for bloody end so fans were shocked when she nonchalantly went topless in the 1983 comedy Trading Places.\nIn 1981, America's sweetheart Julie Andrews yes, she played Mary Poppins...and Maria Von Trapp went fearlessly topless in S.O.B., movie written and directed by her husband Blake Edwards.\n'Choke' This 2008 dark comedy based on the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk isn't surprising place to find nudity, but we'll admit that we were shocked to see Community star Gillian Jacobs go topless in the flick.\n'Just One of the Guys' This PG-13 teen comedy from the '80s has classic, very Twelfth Night -y-- high school girl poses as guy to prove sexism is thing.\nPretty normal, right?\nThe surprising thing is that, at the very end of the movie, to reveal her true sex, our heroine rips open her tux, exposing her, uh, secret.\nDidn't see that coming.\n'Romeo and Juliet' We've pointed out plenty of PG-13 nudity, but the old-school Romeo and Juliet from 1968 wins the award for the most family-friendly nude scene.\nThe film is rated PG, yet features blissfully topless Juliet after her wedding night with Romeo.\n'Bare' With title like Bare you knew this one was going to have some less-than- clothed moments.\nBut the 2015 drama forced the world to see Glee star Dianna Agron in very new light.\n'Malicious' Molly Ringwald spent the '80s making name for herself as the princess/girl next door of teen movies.\nBy 1995, she was ready to shed the squeaky clean teen queen vibes and she did exactly that in an erotic thriller called Malicious in which she played \"disturbed medical student\" who stars stalking her school's star baseball player after brief fling.\n'All the Right Moves' If you wouldn't exactly expect nudity in an '80s sports drama starring pre- couch jumping Tom Cruise, then you're not alone.\nIf you really wouldn't expect that nudity to come from Lorraine McFly herself, Lea Thompson, then you're also not alone, but that's exactly what you'll get in All the Right Moves.\nKayleigh Roberts Contributor Kayleigh
