Native Americans Are at the Greatest Risk of Sexual Violence On average, American Indians ages 12 and older experience 5,900 sexual assaults per year.14 American Indians are twice as likely to experience rape/sexual assault compared to all races.\n41% of sexual assaults against American Indians are committed by stranger; 34% by an acquaintance; and 25% by an intimate or family member.\nOf the 14,900 survivors, 43% of females and 17% of males reported.\nView statistics on additional topics.\nUnderstanding RAINN\u2019s statistics Sexual violence is notoriously difficult to measure, and there is no single source of data that provides complete picture of the crime.\nOn RAINN\u2019s website, we have tried to select the most reliable source of statistics for each topic.\nThe primary data source we use is theNational Crime Victimization Survey NCVS which is an annual study conducted by the Justice Department.\nTo conduct NCVS, researchers interview tens of thousands of Americans each year to learn about crimes that they\u2019ve experienced.\nBased on those interviews, the study provides estimates of the total number of crimes, including those that were not reported to police.\nWhile NCVS has number of limitations most importantly, children under age 12 are not included overall, it is the most reliable source of crime statistics in the U.S. We have also relied on other Justice Department studies, as well as data from the Department of Health and Human Services and other government and academic sources.\nWhen assembling these statistics, we have generally retained the wording used by the authors.\nStatistics are presented for educational purposes only.\nEach statistic includes footnote citation for the original source, where you can find information about the methodology and definition of terms.
