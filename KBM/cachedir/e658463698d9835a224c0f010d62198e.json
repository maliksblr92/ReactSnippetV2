For some people, that means reporting the crime immediately and fighting to see the rapist brought to justice.\nFor others it means seeking medical or emotional care without reporting the rape as crime.\nEvery person is different.\nThere are three things that everyone who has been raped should do, though: 1.\nKnow that the rape wasn't your fault.\nSeek medical care.\nDeal with your feelings.\nIt's Not Your Fault Whatever happened, it wasn't your fault.\nNo one has the right to have sex with you against your will.\nThe blame for rape lies solely with the rapist.\nSometimes rapist will try to exert even more power by making the person who's been raped feel like it was actually his or her fault.\nrapist may say stuff like, \"You asked for it\" or \"You wanted it.\"\nThis is just another way for the rapist to take control.\nThe truth is that what person wears, what person says, or how person acts is never justification for rape.\nMost people who are raped know their rapists.\nThat can sometimes lead the person who's been raped to try to protect the perpetrator.\nMake protecting yourself your priority. Don't worry about protecting the person who raped you.\nIf you want to report the crime to the police, do so.\nReporting rape may help protect others from that person -- and may help you feel little less like you were victim.\nBut making report to the police may be difficult for some people.\nIf you don't feel comfortable reporting it, you don't have to.\nYou may prefer to get advice about what to do from an experienced adult who can be sympathetic to you.\nDo whatever helps you to feel safe and heal without blaming yourself.\nSeek Medical Care The first thing someone who has been raped needs to do is see medical doctor.\nMost medical centers and hospital emergency departments have doctors and counselors who have been trained to take care of someone who has been raped.\nIt's important to get medical care because doctor will need to check you for sexually transmitted diseases STDs and internal injuries.\nMost areas have local rape hotlines that can give you advice about where to go for medical help.\nYou may want to have friend or family member go along for support, especially if you're feeling upset and unsafe.\nSome rape crisis centers also provide advocates who can go along with you.\nYou can also call the national sexual assault hotline at 800 656-HOPE.\nIf you are under 18 and don't want your parents to know about the rape, ask the rape crisis center about the laws in your area.\nMany jurisdictions treat rape exams confidentially, but some will require that parent or guardian be notified.\nYou should get medical attention right away without changing your clothes, showering, douching, or washing.\nIt can be hard not to clean up, of course -- it's natural human instinct to wash away all traces of sexual assault.\nBut being examined right away is the best way to ensure you get proper medical treatment.\nImmediate medical attention also helps when people decide to report the crime, providing evidence needed to prosecute the rapist if criminal case is pursued.\nIf you've been raped and think you don't want to report it, you could change your mind later -- this often happens -- and having the results of medical exam can help you do this.\nThere are laws, known as statutes of limitations, that give person only certain amount of time to pursue legal action for crime, though, so be sure you know how long you have to report the rape.\nlocal rape crisis center can advise you of the laws in your area.\nEven if you don't get examined right away, it doesn't mean you can't get checkup later.\nIt's always best to see doctor immediately after rape, of course.\nBut person can still go to doctor or local clinic to get checked out for STDs, pregnancy, or injuries any time after being raped.\nIn some cases, doctors can even gather evidence several days after rape has occurred.\nWhat Happens During the Medical Exam?\nWhen you go to the hospital after rape, trained counselor or social worker will listen while you talk about what happened.\nTalking to trained listener can help you begin to release some of the emotions you are probably feeling so that you can start to feel calm and safe again.\nThe counselor may also talk with you about the medical exam and what it involves.\nEach state or jurisdiction has different requirements, of course, but here are some of the things that may happen during the medical exam: medical professional will test you for STDs, including HIV/AIDS.\nThese tests may involve taking blood or saliva samples.\nAlthough the thought of getting an STD after rape is extremely scary, the quicker person finds out about any infection, the more effectively he or she can be treated.\nDoctors can start you on immediate treatment courses for STDs, including HIV/AIDS, that will greatly increase your protection against developing these diseases.\nIf you're female, medical professional may treat you to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, if you wish.\nmedical professional will examine you internally to check for any injury that might have been caused by the rape.\nmedical professional or trained technician may look for and take samples of the rapist's hair, skin, nails, or bodily fluids from your clothes or body.\nIf you think you've been given rape drug, doctor or technician can test for this, too.\nBe aware that this toxicology test covers any and all illegal drugs.\nAt any time during the medical exam, you can say if you don't want certain test performed or evidence collected.\nAll procedures are being done to help you so you have control over which procedures you'd like done, as well as say in any you don't want.\nDealing With Feelings Rape isn't just physically damaging, it can be emotionally traumatic as well.\nThe right emotional attention, care, and support can help person begin the healing process and prevent lingering problems later on.\nSomeone who has been raped might feel lot of things: angry, degraded, frightened, numb, or confused.\nIt's also normal for someone who has been raped to feel ashamed or embarrassed.\nSome people withdraw from friends and family.\nOthers don't want to be alone.\nSome feel depressed, anxious, or nervous.\nSometimes the feelings surrounding rape may show up in physical ways, such as trouble sleeping or eating.\nIt may be hard to concentrate in school or to participate in everyday activities.\nSometimes it may feel like you'll never get over the trauma of the rape.\nExperts often refer to these emotions -- and their physical side effects -- as rape trauma syndrome. The best way to work through them is with professional help.\nIt can be hard to think or talk about frightening experience, especially something as personal as rape.\nPeople who have been raped sometimes avoid seeking help because they're afraid that talking about it will bring back memories or feelings that are too painful.\nBut this can actually do more harm than good.\nTalking about rape in safe environment with the help and support of trained professional is the best way to ensure long-term healing.\nWorking through the pain sooner rather than later can help reduce symptoms like nightmares and flashbacks.\nIt can also help people avoid potentially harmful behaviors and emotions, like major depression or self-injury.\nEvery rape survivor works through his or her feelings differently.\nSome people feel most comfortable talking one-on-one with therapist.\nOthers find that joining support group where they can be with other survivors helps them to feel better, get their power back, and move on with their lives.\nIn support group, you can get help and support as well as give it.\nYour experiences and ideas may help others heal.\nReviewed by:D'Arcy Lyness, PhD Date reviewed: August 2015 More on this topic for: Teens Emergency Contraception Abuse STDs Sexually Transmitted Diseases Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Sexual Harassment and Sexual Bullying Date Rape Abusive Relationships Gyn Checkups How Can Help Friend Who Was Raped?\nView more About Us Contact Us Partners Editorial Policy Permissions Guidelines Privacy Policy Terms of Use Notice of Nondiscrimination Note: All information on TeensHealth\u00ae is for educational purposes only.\nFor specific medical advice, diagnoses, and treatment, consult your doctor.\n1995- The Nemours Foundation.\nAll rights reserved.\nImages provided by The Nemours Foundation, iStock, Getty Images, Veer, Shutterstock, and Clipart.com.\n"}
