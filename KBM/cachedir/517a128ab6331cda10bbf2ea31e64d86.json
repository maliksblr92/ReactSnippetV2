Samuel of IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an IBM 704 not merely to play checkers but \"learn\" from its own experience.\nIn 1957 the FORTRAN scientific programming language was developed.\nIn 1961 IBM developed the SABRE reservation system for American Airlines and introduced the highly successful Selectric typewriter.\nIn 1963 IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flights of the Mercury astronauts.\nyear later, it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to Armonk, New York.\nThe latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights, and 1969 lunar mission.\nAn IBM System/360 in use at the University of Michigan c. 1969.\nOn April 7, 1964, IBM announced the first computer system family, the IBM System/360.\nIt spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications.\nIt was followed by the IBM System/370 in 1970.\nTogether the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s.\nIn 1991 IBM spun out its printer manufacturing into new business called Lexmark.\nLater in 2009, IBM's Blue Gene supercomputing program was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by U.S. President Barack Obama.\nIn 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence program Watson, which was exhibited on Jeopardy!
