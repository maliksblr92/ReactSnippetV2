However, actual prevalence may be higher because rape and sexual assault tend to be underreported.\nFemales are raped and sexually assaulted more often than males.\nMale rape is often committed by another man, often in prison.\nMales who are raped are more likely than females to be physically injured, to be unwilling to report the crime, and to have multiple assailants.\nSymptoms and Signs Rape may result in the following: Extragenital injury Genital injury Psychologic symptoms Sexually transmitted diseases STDs\u2014eg, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis Hepatitis HIV infection Bacterial vaginosis Pregnancy Most physical injuries are relatively minor, but some lacerations of the upper vagina are severe.\nAdditional injuries may result from being struck, pushed, stabbed, or shot.\nRecent evidence indicates that lifetime experience of rape is also related to long-term physical health problems; for example, risk of developing asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, frequent headaches, or chronic pain is higher for rape victims than for people who are not victims of rape Psychologic symptoms of rape are potentially the most prominent.\nIn the short term, most patients experience fear, nightmares, sleep problems, anger, embarrassment, shame, guilt, or combination.\nThey may be unable to remember important parts of the event dissociative amnesia, which is symptom of acute stress disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD Immediately after an assault, patient behavior can range from talkativeness, tenseness, crying, and trembling to shock and disbelief with dispassion, quiescence, and smiling.\nThe latter responses rarely indicate lack of concern; rather, they reflect avoidance reactions, physical exhaustion, or coping mechanisms that require control of emotion.\nAnger may be displaced onto hospital staff or family members.\nFor acute stress disorder to be diagnosed, symptoms must be present for days to month after the rape.\nFriends, family members, and officials may react judgmentally, derisively, or in another negative way.\nSuch reactions can impede recovery after an assault.\nEventually, most patients recover; however, long-range effects of rape may include PTSD, particularly among women.\nPTSD is trauma-related disorder; symptoms of PTSD include Re-experiencing the trauma eg, flashbacks, intrusive upsetting thoughts or images Avoidance eg, of trauma-related situations, thoughts, and feelings Negative effects on cognition and mood eg, persistent distorted blame of self or others, inability to experience positive emotions Altered arousal and reactivity eg, sleep difficulties, irritability, concentration problems For PTSD to be diagnosed, symptoms must last for month, must not be attributable to the physiologic effects of substance or medical disorder, and must significantly impair social and occupational functioning.\nPatients with PTSD often also have depression and/or other psychologic disorders eg, substance use disorder Symptoms and signs references 1\\.

Basile KC, Smith SG, Chen J, Zwald M: Chronic diseases, health conditions, and other impacts associated with rape victimization of U.S. women.\nInterpers Violence 23:886260519900335, 2020. doi: 10.1177/0886260519900335.\nEpub ahead of print Evaluation Goals of rape evaluation are Medical assessment and treatment of injuries and assessment, treatment, and prevention of pregnancy and STDs Collection of forensic evidence Psychologic evaluation Recommendation of crisis intervention and psychologic support If patients seek advice before medical evaluation, they are told not to throw out or change clothing, wash, shower, douche, brush their teeth, clip their fingernails, or use mouthwash; doing so may destroy evidence.\nWhenever possible, all people who are raped are referred to local rape center, often hospital emergency department; such centers are staffed by specially trained practitioners eg, sexual assault nurse examiners SANE Some areas in the US have sexual assault response team SART which includes members from health care, forensics, the local rape crisis center, law enforcement, and the prosecutor's office.\nBenefits of rape evaluation are explained, but patients are free to consent to or decline the evaluation.\nThe police are notified if patients consent.\nMost patients are greatly traumatized, and their care requires sensitivity, empathy, and compassion.\nPatients may feel more comfortable with physician of the same sex; all patients should be asked about their preference before the examination.\nfemale staff member should accompany all males evaluating female.\nPatients are provided privacy and quiet whenever possible.\nform sometimes part of rape kit is used to record legal evidence and medical findings for typical elements in the form, see table Typical Examination for Alleged Rape it should be adapted to local requirements.\nBecause the medical record may be used in court, results should be written legibly and in nontechnical language that can be understood by jury.\nTable Typical Examination for Alleged Rape Category Specifics ---|--- General information Demographic data about the patient Name, address, and phone number of the guardian if the patient is under age Name of police officer, badge number, and department Date, time, and location of examination History Circumstances of attack, including Date, time, and location familiar to patient?\nInformation about assailants number, name if known, description Use of threats, restraints, or weapon Type of sexual contact vaginal, oral, rectal; use of condom?\nIf the test cannot be done immediately, specimen should be placed in freezer.\nThis test should be done by the examining physician if it can be done in time to detect motile sperm.\nIn 80% of cases, blood group substances are found in semen.\nThis test is not recommended by all authorities because evidence of preexisting sexually transmitted diseases may be used to discredit the patient in court.\n|| Many authorities recommend not including comments or tests regarding the presence of alcohol or drugs in the patient because evidence of intoxication may be used to discredit the patient in court.\nHistory and examination Before beginning, the examiner asks the patient\u2019s permission.\nBecause recounting the events often frightens or embarrasses the patient, the examiner must be reassuring, empathetic, and nonjudgmental and should not rush the patient.\nPrivacy should be ensured.\nResults should be reviewed with the patient.\nWhen feasible, photographs of possible injuries are taken.\nThe mouth, breasts, genitals, and rectum are examined closely.\nCommon sites of injury include the labia minora and posterior vagina.\nExamination using Wood\u2019s lamp may detect semen or foreign debris on the skin.\nColposcopy is particularly sensitive for subtle genital injuries.\nSome colposcopes have cameras attached, making it possible to detect and photograph injuries simultaneously.\nWhether use of toluidine blue to highlight areas of injury is accepted as evidence varies by jurisdiction.\nTesting and evidence collection Routine testing includes pregnancy test and serologic tests for syphilis, hepatitis B, and HIV; if done within few hours of rape, these tests provide information about pregnancy or infections present before the rape but not those that develop after the rape.\nVaginal discharge is examined to check for trichomonal vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis; samples from every penetrated orifice vaginal, oral, or rectal are obtained for gonorrheal and chlamydial testing.\nIf the patient has amnesia for events around the time of rape, drug screening for flunitrazepam the date rape drug and gamma hydroxybutyrate should be considered.\nTesting for drugs of abuse and alcohol is controversial because evidence of intoxication may be used to discredit the patient.\nFollow-up tests for the following are done: At weeks: Gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, human papillomavirus infection initially using cervical sample from Papanicolaou test syphilis, and hepatitis At 90 days: HIV infection At months: Syphilis, hepatitis, and HIV infection However, testing for STDs is controversial because evidence of preexisting STDs may be used to discredit the patient in court.\nIf the vagina was penetrated and the pregnancy test was negative at the first visit, the test is repeated within the next weeks.\nPatients with lacerations of the upper vagina, especially children, may require laparoscopy to determine depth of the injury.\nEvidence that can provide proof of rape is collected see table Typical Examination for Alleged Rape it typically includes Clothing Smears of the buccal, vaginal, and rectal mucosa Combed samples of scalp and pubic hair as well as control samples pulled from the patient Fingernail clippings and scrapings Blood and saliva samples If available, semen Many types of evidence collection kits are available commercially, and some states recommend specific kits.\nEvidence is often absent or inconclusive after showering, changing clothes, or activities that involve sites of penetration, such as douching.\nEvidence becomes weaker or disappears as time passes, particularly after 36 hours; however, depending on the jurisdiction, evidence may be collected up to days after rape.\nchain of custody, in which evidence is in the possession of an identified person at all times, must be maintained.\nThus, specimens are placed in individual packages, labeled, dated, sealed, and held until delivery to another person typically, law enforcement or laboratory personnel who signs receipt.\nIn some jurisdictions, samples for DNA testing to identify the assailant are collected.\nClinicians should encourage patients to seek help with managing the effects of their trauma and with restoring their ability to function crisis intervention and to seek psychologic support.\nTreatment Psychologic support and/or crisis intervention Prophylaxis for STDs Tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV infection When indicated, prophylaxis for hepatitis and HIV infection Possibly emergency contraception After the evaluation, the patient is provided with facilities to wash, change clothing, use mouthwash, and urinate or defecate if needed.\nlocal rape crisis team can provide referrals for medical, psychologic, and legal support services.\nMost physical injuries are minor and are treated conservatively.\nVaginal lacerations may require surgical repair.\nPsychologic support Sometimes examiners can use commonsense measures eg, reassurance, general support, nonjudgmental attitude to relieve strong emotions of guilt or anxiety.\nPossible psychologic and social effects of rape are explained, and the patient is introduced to specialist trained in rape crisis intervention.\nBecause the full psychologic effects cannot always be ascertained at the first examination, follow-up visits are scheduled at 2-week intervals.\nSevere psychologic effects eg, persistent flashbacks, significant sleep disruption, fear leading to significant avoidance or psychologic effects still present at follow-up visits warrant psychiatric or psychologic referral.\nFamily members and friends can provide vital support eg, gentle encouragement, reminders that the rape was not their fault but they may need help from rape crisis specialists in handling their own negative reactions.\nPTSD can be effectively treated psychosocially and pharmacologically.\nPrevention of infections Routine empiric prophylaxis for STDs consists of Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM in single dose for gonorrhea Metronidazole orally in single dose for trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis Either doxycycline 100 mg orally times day for days or azithromycin orally once for chlamydial infection Alternatively, azithromycin orally which covers gonorrhea and chlamydial infection with metronidazole orally, both as single dose For hepatitis B, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC recommends hepatitis vaccination unless the patient has been previously vaccinated and has documented immunity.\nThe vaccine is repeated and months after the first dose.\nHepatitis immune globulin HBIG is not given.\nEmpiricpostexposure prophylaxis for HIV infection is controversial.\nMost authorities recommend offering prophylaxis; however, the patient should be told that on average, the risk of HIV infection after rape from an unknown assailant is only about 0.2%. Risk may be higher with any of the following: Anal penetration Bleeding assailant or victim Male-male rape Rape by multiple assailants eg, male victims in prisons Rape in areas with high prevalence of HIV infection Prophylaxis for HIV infection is best begun hours after penetration and should not be given after 72 hours.\nUsually, fixed-dose combination of zidovudine ZDV 300 mg and lamivudine 3TC 150 mg is given orally times day for weeks if exposure appears low risk.\nIf risk is higher, protease inhibitor is added.\nPrevention of pregnancy Emergency contraception should be offered to all women with negative pregnancy test.\nUsually, oral contraceptives are used; if used 72 hours after rape, they are much less likely to be effective.\nAn antiemetic may help if nausea develops.\nAn intrauterine device may be effective if used up to 10 days after rape.\nIf pregnancy results from rape, the patient\u2019s attitude toward the pregnancy and abortion should be determined, and if appropriate, the option of elective termination should be discussed.\nKey Points Typically, rape is an expression of aggression, anger, or need for power; psychologically, it is more violent than sexual.\nNongenital or genital injury occurs in about 50% of rapes of females; males who are raped are more likely than females to be physically injured.\nIn the short term, most patients experience fear, nightmares, sleep problems, anger, embarrassment, and other psychologic symptoms; although most patients eventually recover; some develop posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD Explain the benefits of rape evaluation, which the patient can consent to or decline; ask the patient's permission before beginning the examination and explain what each step involves and why it is being done.\nCheck for injuries, test for pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, collect evidence that can provide proof of rape eg, smears of the buccal, vaginal, and rectal mucosa and maintain chain of custody.\nProvide psychologic support for the patient and the patient's family, provide prophylaxis for sexually transmitted diseases, and offer emergency contraception.\nClick here for Patient Education NOTE: This is the Professional Version.\nCONSUMERS: Click here for the Consumer Version (C) 2020 Merck Sharp Dohme Corp., subsidiary of Merck Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA Phyllodes Tumor Was This Page Helpful?\nYes No Domestic Violence Professionals also read Overview of Child Maltreatment Overview of the Spleen Overview of Vascular Disorders of the Liver Also of Interest Videos View All Video How to Repair Second Degree Vaginal Laceration 3D Models View All 3D Model Vaginal Birth SOCIAL MEDIA Follow Follow Add to Any Platform MSD and the MSD Manuals Merck Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA known as MSD outside of the US and Canada is global healthcare leader working to help the world be well.\nFrom developing new therapies that treat and prevent disease to helping people in need, we are committed to improving health and well-being around the world.\nThe Manual was first published in 1899 as service to the community.\nThe legacy of this great resource continues as the Merck Manual in the US and Canada and the MSD Manual outside of North America.\nLearn more about our commitment to Global Medical Knowledge.
