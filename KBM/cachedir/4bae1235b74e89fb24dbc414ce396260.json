but it had the very slightest tincture of theology.\nView in context Why, since it had been built, no less than four families that their informant could name had tried to buy it and failed.\nThe families had all been of different nationalities--there had been representative of several races that had displaced each other in the stockyards.\nView in context That the extinct forms of life help to fill up the wide intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, cannot be disputed.\nBut apprehend that in perfectly natural classification many fossil species would have to stand between living species, and some extinct genera between living genera, even between genera belonging to distinct families.\nThe most common case, especially with respect to very distinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems to be, that supposing them to be distinguished at the present day from each other by dozen characters, the ancient members of the same two groups would be distinguished by somewhat lesser number of characters, so that the two groups, though formerly quite distinct, at that period made some small approach to each other.\nView in context This would be cheaper, since one frame would serve for all, and it would be infinitely more genteel; for all families of any taste were now drawn in the same manner.\nView in context Yes, indeed, have often thought with bitter joy that these riches, which would make the wealth of dozen families, will be forever lost to those men who persecute me.\n\"The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they cannot touch.\"\nEdmond thought he was in dream -- he wavered between incredulity and joy.\nThis information should not be considered complete, up to date, and is not intended to be used in place of visit, consultation, or advice of legal, medical, or any other professional.\n"}
