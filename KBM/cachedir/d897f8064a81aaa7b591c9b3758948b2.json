don\u2019t read further than you\u2019ve watched.\nSee all of their coverage here \u201cHang the DJ\u201d might have been my favorite episode of the season.\nYes, it hits you over the head with the metaphor, but it\u2019s such perfect deployment of Charlie Brooker\u2019s skills: relatable comedy, subtle sci-fi, melancholy British fatalism about life and love.\nPlus the two leads neither of whom knew were just so charming together.\nThe final mind-blowing, world-expanding twist at the end worked for me; since the metaphor for dating algorithms was so obvious already, why not make it literal?\nThat might have been the season\u2019s high point in my book, but the next entry, \u201cMetalhead,\u201d still marked necessary tonal shift.\nAnytime load an episode of weighty Netflix drama, nothing makes me happier than when see 40-minute running time.\nOf all my complaints about Peak TV, the biggest is how indulgent so many creators have become, and how overlong they make their shows as result.\nSo I\u2019m almost automatically inclined to give \u201cMetalhead\u201d good review, considering how taut its storytelling is.\nBeyond that, though, it was also an example of something I\u2019d love to see Black Mirror do more and more if it continues after this season\u2014a straightforward piece of genre television, largely lacking in twists or gimmicks.\n\u201cMetalhead\u201d was written by Brooker and directed by David Slade, stylish visual craftsman who\u2019s been behind some of the best-looking TV of recent memory, including Hannibal and American Gods.\nSlade got his start in music videos, and it shows in the crisp black-and-white photography of \u201cMetalhead\u201d and its spare, frightening world design.\nThe story is set in post- apocalyptic Britain of some sort, mostly taking place on the sweeping Scottish moors.\nWe\u2019re not told what ruined the world or why it is the way it is, nor do we need to know.\nThis is just an eye-popping tale of survival, pitting an empty-handed woman, Bella Maxine Peake against some lingering remnant of technological police state.\nThe titular \u201cMetalhead\u201d is \u201cdog,\u201d terrier-sized cybernetic drone that roves around on little feet and shoots and stabs anyone it comes across without remorse.\nThis drone can hack any door or computer with USB key; it also has little bit of trouble climbing things.\nApart from that, it doesn\u2019t have any discernible motivation or personality; it\u2019s just faceless enemy for our hero to do battle with.\nprefer grim Black Mirror episode that\u2019s entirely about mood and suspense to one like \u201cCrocodile,\u201d which tries to make larger point but never comes close to hitting the target.\nIt also helps that the violence in \u201cMetalhead\u201d is brief and shocking, arriving in short spurts any time the drone comes across living target.\nMost of the drama is wrapped up in wondering what will come next, rather than figuring out the extent of some real-life allegory, which makes the dark mood easier to put up with.\nAnother thing in its favor?\nHow short it is!\nNot to sound like broken record, but there\u2019s almost no Black Mirror episode that wouldn\u2019t be improved by trimmed running time, even really good ones like \u201cUSS Callister\u201d which was comparably roomy 75 minutes long \u201cMetalhead\u201d didn\u2019t have enough time to wear out its welcome with me, nor did it waste moment on things that didn\u2019t matter to its primary narrative.\nOur hero begins her journey with two other scavengers, who are quickly wiped out by the \u201cdog\u201d; she spends the rest of the action fleeing its Terminator-like pursuit, including hiding in tree, taking advantage of its sleep mode to sneak away, and finally locating shotgun to take it out once and for all.\n\u201cMetalhead\u201d doesn\u2019t play up the gore, unlike many one-person narratives about survival in the wilderness though there is one pretty gross sequence involving the removal of tracking bug with knife The visuals were what carried me through the quieter moments, with Slade making sure every glimpse of the empty moors in high-contrast black-and-white photography jumps out at the viewer.\nPeake, whom best know from U.K. comedies like Dinnerladies and Shameless also keeps things grounded with her understated performance, which could have easily leaned on her terror and instead focuses on her resolve to survive.\nThe final \u201ctwist\u201d of \u201cMetalhead\u201d is perhaps little too cute\u2014we see that the precious item Bella was looking for when she initially disturbed the drone was teddy bear, to help comfort child living in horrible world.\nIt\u2019s just about the only shred of recognizable humanity in an episode that otherwise reduces people to animals being hunted.\nUnlike the appearance of the hamster at the end of \u201cCrocodile,\u201d was happy to have the jarring sight of the bear close out this story.\n\u201cMetalhead\u201d also makes for good, punchy penultimate installment before the meta-textual stylings of \u201cBlack Museum,\u201d which wraps up Season 4.\nSophie, were you as charmed by the simplicity of this episode as was?\nRead Sophie Gilbert\u2019s review of the next and final episode of the season, \u201cBlack Museum.\u201d We want to hear what you think about this article.\nSubmit letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.\nDavid Sims is staff writer at The Atlantic where he covers culture.\nConnect Twitter About Our History Staff Careers Contact Help Center Contact Us Advertise Press Podcasts Social Distance\u2122 Floodlines The Ticket: Politics from The Atlantic Crazy/Genius Subscription Purchase Give Gift Manage Subscription Download iOS App Newsletters Follow Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Personal Information Advertising Guidelines Terms Conditions Responsible Disclosure Site Map TheAtlantic.com Copyright 2020 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.\nAll Rights Reserved.\n"}
