those without power may use nudity as form of protest, and those with power may impose nakedness on others as form of punishment.\nThe use of clothing is one of the changes that mark the end of the Neolithic and the beginning of civilization.\nThis change in environment also resulted in change in diet, from largely vegetarian to hunting.\nSome of these changes are thought to be the result of sexual selection, which was first proposed by Darwin in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex.\nBy selecting more hairless mates, humans accelerated changes initiated by natural selection.\nOther primate mothers do not need to carry their young because there is fur for them to cling to, but the loss of fur encouraged full bipedalism, allowing the mothers to carry their babies with one or both hands.\nThe combination of hairlessness and upright posture may also explain the enlargement of the female breasts as sexual signal.[7] With the loss of fur, darker, high-melanin skin evolved as protection from ultraviolet radiation damage.\nSlaves and laborers were nude or wore loincloths.\nOnly women of the upper classes wore kalasiris dress of loose draped or translucent linen which came from just above or below the breasts to the ankles.[21] Women entertainers performed naked.\nThese later styles are often shown in film and TV as representing ancient Egypt in all periods.[21] Male nudity was celebrated in ancient Greece as in no culture before or since.\nThey considered embarrassment at having to disrobe for sports sign of barbarism.[23] The female nude emerged as subject for art in the 5th century BCE, illustrating stories of women bathing both indoors and outdoors.\nWhile depictions of nude women were erotic in nature, there was no attribution of impropriety as would be the case for such images in later Western culture.\nSide from an Attic red-figure stamnos, 440\u2013430 BCE.\nClothing used in the Middle East, which loosely envelopes the entire body, changed little for centuries.\nThe philosophical meaning of this myth in terms of stating the source of shame is unclear.\nThe \"original sin\" did not involve nakedness, but disobedience, yet the first response was to cover their bodies with fig leaves.[29] In all three religions, modesty generally prevails in public, with clothing covering all parts of the body of sexual nature.\nThe Torah set forth laws regarding clothing and modesty tzniut which also separated Jews from other people in the societies they lived within.[30] Early Christians generally inherited the norms of dress from Jewish traditions.\nHowever, the Adamites were an obscure Christian sect in North Africa originating in the second century who worshiped in the nude, professing to have regained the innocence of Adam.[31] Islamic clothing for both men and women is in accordance with the rules of hajib.\nFor men, clothing covers the area from the waist to the knees.\nFor women, clothing covers the area from the neck to the ankles and also covers the hair.\nThe practice known as veiling of women in public predates Islam in Persia, Syria, and Anatolia.\nThe Qur\u02be\u0101n provides guidance on the dress of women, but not strict rulings;[28] such rulings may be found in the Hadith.\nHowever, nakedness could also be used by an individual to express contempt for others in their presence.\nThe practice continues at dwindling number of hot springs konyoku outside of urban areas.[34] Another Japanese tradition was the women free-divers ama who for 2,000 years until the 1960s collected seaweed and shellfish wearing only loincloths.\nTheir nakedness was not shocking, since women farmers often worked bare-breasted during the summer.[35] Post-classical history The late fourth century CE was period of both of Christian conversion and standardization of church teachings, in particular on matters of sex.\nSex outside marriage with respectable woman injured third parties; her husband, father, and male relatives.\nAt the beginning of the period, everyone other that the upper classes lived in close quarters and did not have the modern sensitivity to private nudity, but slept and bathed together naked with innocence rather than shame.\nIn 1350, breasts were associated with nourishment and loving care, but by 1750, artistic representations of the breast were either erotic or medical.\nThis eroticization of the breast coincided with the persecution of women as witches.[43] In the medieval period, Islamic norms became more patriarchal, and very concerned with the chastity of women before marriage and fidelity afterward.\nWhile Christians were mainly concerned about mixed-gender bathing, which was not uncommon, Islam prohibited nudity for women in the company of non-Muslim women.[45] Modern history Early modern The association of nakedness with shame and anxiety became ambivalent during the Renaissance.\nHowever, throughout the United Kingdom in the 19th century, workers in coal mines were naked due to the heat and the narrow tunnels that would catch on clothing.\nCivic leaders had not intended pools to be used for recreation, but for health and sporting activities, which were male only.\nSome contemporary societies, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and the Amazon rainforest, maintain their traditional norms, going about their everyday activities either nude or partially nude.\nWhen she weds they will be cut.\nKayapo women, Par\u00e1 State, Brazil Two women of the Zo'\u00e9 tribe of Par\u00e1 State, Brazil General issues Child development See also: Child sexuality and Puberty The National Child Traumatic Stress Network issued report in 2009 on child sexual development in the United States.\nThe report asserted that children have natural curiosity about their own bodies and the bodies of others that ought to be addressed in an age-appropriate manner.\nAccording to the report: Children less than four years old will normally touch their own private parts, look at the private parts of others, and remove their clothes wanting to be naked; Between ages four and six, children will be more actively curious.\nThey will attempt to see others dressing or undressing, or will perhaps \"play doctor\"; Between ages six and twelve, children will expand their curiosity to images of undressed people available in the media.\nThey will develop need for privacy regarding their own bodies and begin to be sexually attracted to peers.\nIt is noted that modern psychology generally agrees that children can benefit from an open environment where the bodies of others their own age of both sexes are not mystery.\nHowever, there is less agreement regarding children and adults being nude.\nWhile some doctors have taken the view that some exposure of children to adult nudity particularly parental nudity may be healthy, others\u2014notably Benjamin Spock\u2014disagreed.\nThe response from right wing French politicians was that the book is immoral, and claimed that liberal politicians had place the book on school reading lists, which was not true.\nRather than diagrams or photos, the videos are shot in locker room with live nude people of all ages.\nThe presenter, physician, is relaxed about close examination and touching of relevant body parts, including genitals.\nWhile the videos note that the age of consent in Norway is 16, abstinence is not emphasized.\nMany were accidental walking in on someone and were more likely to be remembered as negative by women.\nOnly 4.72% of women and 2% of men reported seeing nude images as part of sex education.\n83.59% of women and 89.45% of men reported that their first image of nudity was in film, video, or other mass media.[69] High and low context cultures See also: Naturism in Germany and Naturism in France High and low context cultures were defined by Edward T. Hall.\nGermans are extremely low in cultural context.\nThey are characterized by individualism, alienation, estrangement from other people, little body contact, low sensitivity to nonverbal cues, and segmentation of time and space.\nBy contrast, the French, in their personal lives are relatively high context: they interact within closely knit groups, are sensitive to nonverbal cues, and engage in relatively high amounts of body contact.\nTo maintain public propriety on nude beach, German naturists avoided touching themselves and others and avoid any adornments or behaviors that would call attention to the body.\nFrench naturists, on the other hand, were more likely than Germans to wear make-up and jewelry and to touch others as they would while dressed.[71] Concepts of privacy Societies in continental Europe conceive of privacy as protecting right to respect and personal dignity.\nIn America, the right to privacy is oriented toward values of liberty, especially in one's home.\nHistorically, such shame has affected women more than men.\nWith regard to their naked bodies, the result is tendency towards self-criticism by women, while men are less concerned by the evaluation of others.[73] In many European counties women may sunbathe without covering their breasts.\nIn much of the world, the modesty of women is matter not only of social custom but of the legal definition of indecent exposure.\nWhere public breastfeeding is legal right, some mothers may be reluctant to breastfeed,[76][77] and some people may object to the practice.[78] Imposed nudity See also: Pantsing Punishment In some situations, nudity is forced on person.\nFor example, imposed nudity full or partial can be part of corporal punishment or as humiliation, especially when administered in public.\nFor example, in 2017, students at girls' school in the north-east Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh were forced to undress as form of punishment, police say.\nNazis used forced nudity to attempt to humiliate inmates in concentration camps.\nThis practice was depicted in the film Schindler's List 1994 .[80] In 2003, Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad Iraq gained international notoriety for accounts of torture and abuses by members of the United States Army Reserve during the post-invasion period.\nThis was the case in 2006, when three young men who had been skinny-dipping outside Brattleboro, Vermont decided to go into town to see what would happen if they disrobed there.\nThey were not arrested, and the following two summers saw number of incidents of public nakedness until an ordinance banning nudity was passed.[84] In the 21st century United States, the legal definition of \"full nudity\" is exposure of the genitals.\nWhere the law has been challenged by asserting that nudity by itself in not lewd or disorderly, laws have been amended to specify indecent exposure, usually of the genitals but not always of the breast.\nHis claim was ultimately rejected.[92] The brief, sudden exposure of parts of the body normally hidden from public view has long tradition, taking several forms, which may or may not prompt legal action.\nFlashing refers to the brief public exposure of the genitals or female breasts.[93] At Mardi Gras in New Orleans flashing\u2014an activity that would be prohibited at any other time and place\u2014has become ritual of long standing in celebration of carnival.\nWhile guilt is the emotion experienced in response to particular wrong action, shame is more general and long-lasting self-assessment.[98] Shame is often thought of as positive in response to failure to act in accordance with moral values, thus motivating an individual to do better in the future.\nHowever, shame is often negative as the response to perceived failures to live up to unrealistic expectations.\nThe term naturism is based upon nakedness as being connected to nature in positive way; which includes egalitarianism, that all humans are alike in their nakedness.\nNudity also represents freedom; the liberation of the body is associated with sexual liberation, although many naturists tend to downplay this connection.\nIn some forms of group psychotherapy, nudity has been used to promote open interaction and communication.\nReligious persons who reject the world as it is including all possessions may practice nudism, or use nakedness as protest against an unjust world.[103] Many of the negative associations are the inverse of positive ones.\nIf nudity is truth, nakedness may be an invasion of privacy or the exposure of uncomfortable truths, source of anxiety.\nThe strong connection of nudity to sex produces shame when naked in contexts where sexuality is deemed inappropriate.\nRather than being natural, nakedness is associated with savagery, poverty, criminality, and death.\nTo be deprived of clothes is punishment; humiliating and degrading.[104] Confronted with this ambiguity, some individuals seek to resolve it by working toward greater acceptance of nudity for themselves and others.\nSexuality Main article: Nudity and sexuality See also: Sexual attraction and Physical attractiveness Persons who practice and advocate personal and social nudity distinguish between sexual and non-sexual nudity.\nSituations where nudity is accepted vary.\nWhen there is complete nudity, the facilities are often segregated by sex, but not always.\nFor example, the Friedrichsbad in Baden-Baden has designated times when mixed nude bathing is permitted.\nMost German not to mention French, Spanish and Greek beaches and swimming pools offer FKK clothing-optional areas.\nSuch facilities may include mixed-sex sauna areas where clothing is worn, but bathing areas are gender segregated; nudity is required in those areas.[117][116] Korean spas have opened in the United States, also gender separated except the bathing areas.\nNuba and Surma people \u2014in daily life or on particular occasions.\nThese normal activities are guided by generally accepted norms, the first of which is that the facilities are most often segregated by gender; however, this may not be the case in all cultures.\nKindergarten shower room in K\u00f6ritz, district of Neustadt-Dosse 1987 Changing rooms may be provided in stores, workplaces, or sports facilities to allow people to change their clothing.\nSome changing rooms have individual cubicles or stalls affording varying degrees of privacy.\nLocker rooms and communal showers associated with sports generally lacked any individual space, thus providing minimal physical privacy.\nThe men\u2019s locker room\u2014which historically in Western cultures had been setting for open male social nudity\u2014is, in the 21st century United States, becoming space of modesty and distancing between men.\nFor much of the 20th century, the norm in locker rooms had been for men to undress completely without embarrassment.\nThat norm has changed; in the 21st century, men typically wear towels or other garments in the locker room most of the time and avoid any interaction with others while naked.\nThe change also addresses issues of transgender usage and family use when one parent accompanies children of differing gender.[134] This shift in attitudes has come to societies historically open to nudity.\nIn Denmark, secondary school students are now avoiding showering after gym classes.\nThere are particular contexts in which nudity is tolerated, accepted, or even encouraged in public spaces.\nIn Europe, such contexts include nude beaches, within some intentional communities such as naturist resorts or clubs and at special events.\nWhile some European countries such as Germany, for example are rather tolerant of public nudity,[137] other nations disfavor or punish public nudity.\nIn the United States in 2012, the city council of San Francisco, California banned public nudity in the inner-city area.\nNudism originated in opposition to the industrialization of Europe in the late 19th century.[141] Naturists reject contemporary standards of modesty that discourage personal, family and social nudity.\nThey instead seek to create social environment where individuals feel comfortable being in the company of nude people and being seen nude, either by other naturists or by the general public.[142] Nudism spawned proselytizing literature in the 1920s and 1930s.\nNudism's other common name, naturism, signals its core contention that the naked body is natural and that modesty and shame are cultural impositions with deleterious effects on psychological, sexual, and social well-being.\nSuch beaches are usually on public lands.\nNude beaches may be official legally sanctioned unofficial tolerated by residents and law enforcement or illegal but so isolated as to escape enforcement.\nArts-related activities Distinct from the nude artworks created, sessions where artists, both amateur and professional, work from live models are social situation where nudity has long tradition.\nThe role of the model both as part of visual art education and in the creation of finished works has evolved since antiquity in Western societies and worldwide wherever western cultural practices in the visual arts have been adopted.\nThe gathering itself is proposed as performance art, while the resulting images become statements based upon the identities of people invited to participate by posing, and the location selected; urban, scenic landscapes, or sites of historical significance.\nThe photographers state variety of artistic, cultural, and political reasons for their work, while those being photographed may be professional models or unpaid volunteers attracted to the project for personal reasons.\nSpencer Tunick has been photographing his \"installations\" since 1994, often in urban spaces but also in landscapes.\nIn picture-making civilization, pictorial conventions continually reaffirm what is natural in human appearance, which is part of socialization.[157] In Western societies, the contexts for depictions of nudity include information, art and pornography.\nThese attitudes have changed over time and have become increasingly frowned upon,[160] especially in the case of photography.\nIn recent years, snapshots taken by parents of their nude infant or toddler children were challenged as child pornography.[161] The Venus of Willendorf made between 24,000 and 22,000 BCE.\nArt Main article: Nude art The nude human figure has been one of the subjects of art from its Paleolithic beginnings, and major preoccupation of Western art since the ancient Greeks.\nDance Dance, as sequence of human movement, may be ceremonial, social or one of the performing arts.\nPartial or complete nudity is feature of ceremonial dances in some tropical countries.\nGerman text: \"In den Fitnesszentren und Kuranstalten wurde das finnische Bad, oft gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig ausgestaltet zu ganzen Saunalandschaften, zum selbstverst\u00e4ndlichen Angebot.\nBemerkenswert ist, dass dort heute zumeist auf getrennte Badezeiten f\u00fcr M\u00e4nner und Frauen verzichtet wird.\nNacktheit von Mann und Frau in der Sauna wird hier l\u00e4ngst akzeptiert und das hat ein positives soziales Gesamtklima erzeugt, das selbstregulierend die seltenen Ausnahmen best\u00e4tigen die Regel das Verhalten der Badeg\u00e4ste bestimmt.\nVerp\u00f6hnt ist ... der Versuch, sich in Badekleidung ... unter die Nackten zu mischen\".[113] English translation: \"In the fitness centers and health resorts, the Finnish bath, often designed generously to complete sauna landscapes, was natural offer.\nIt is noteworthy that today there is usually no separate bathing times for men and women.\nNakedness of men and women in the sauna has been accepted for long time and that has created positive overall social climate.\nSelf-regulation the rare exceptions confirm the rule determines the behavior of the bathers.\nPampered is the attempt ... to mix in bathing clothes among the naked ones\".
