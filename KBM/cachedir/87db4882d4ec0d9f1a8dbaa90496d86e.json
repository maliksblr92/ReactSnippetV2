Opinion The Nude Selfie Is Now High Art It has become an act of resilience in isolation, way to seduce without touch.\nBy Diana Spechler Ms. Spechler is novelist.\nApril 24, 2020 Before face-touching became potentially lethal, my friend Dave had lot of lovers.\nNow he makes do with nude selfies.\nHe doesn\u2019t even request them, he said.\nThey appear as if by magic: \u201cI wake up and they are just there.\u201d\nMatthew, an artist in Providence, R.I., said, \u201cI keep getting explicit photos from people thought were just my friends.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know they\u2019re thinking of me.\u201d\nSince the pandemic began, sex has changed: It\u2019s imagined, monogamous, Zoomed or Skyped.\nAnd nude selfies have become one symbol of resilience, refusal to let social distancing render us sexless.\nNude selfies are no longer foreplay, whetting of lover\u2019s appetite, but the whole meal Though the debate about art versus pornography has never been settled, case can be made that quarantine nude selfies are art.\nSome of us finally have time to make art, and this is the art we are making: carefully posed, cast in shadows, expertly filtered.\nThese aren\u2019t garish below-the-belt shots under fluorescent lighting, half-used roll of toilet paper in the background.\nThey are solicited or spontaneous.\nThey are gifts to partners in separate quarantines, friends who aren\u2019t exactly friends, unmet Hinge matches and exes.\nExes are popping up like whack-a-moles these days.\n\u201cBefore the quarantine, navigated under \u2018nudes are for boyfriends\u2019 rule,\u201d said Zoe, marketing assistant in Los Angeles.\n\u201cSomething special for someone trust.\nBut in times of loneliness turn to serial dating and now that plays out via virtual connections.\u201d\nKat, an artist in Arizona who just lost her uncle to Covid-19, has been enjoying the creative process of making and sending sexy selfies over secure app called Wire to bartender she met overseas just before the coronavirus ended nonessential travel.\n\u201cNot to distract from feeling my feelings,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThis is just the human experience, isn\u2019t it?\nIf historically the nude form in art suggested power in men think ancient Greek sculptures of athletes and sexuality in women think Goya\u2019s \u201cLa Maja Desnuda\u201d and every other painting of woman by man nude selfies, especially now, imbue the subject with both.\nThe sexuality component is obvious, the power component contextual: the power to seduce without touch, to connect when physical contact is life-threatening, to impress while we\u2019re home and unemployed and sweat-suited and to stir up strong reaction miles away.\nImage Goya\u2019s \u201cLa Maja Desnuda,\u201d

escaping the constraints of reality,\u201d said Constant Mews, the director of the Center for Religious Studies at Monash University in Australia.\nHe sent me to Pinterest page called Medieval Erotics.\nHe referred me to \u201cThe Decameron,\u201d Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s 14th-century literary response to the Black Plague, collection of 100 short stories in which characters, desperate for distraction from all that illness and death, entertain one another with often bawdy tales.\nIn modern life, has reality ever been so constraining?\nHas technology ever provided such escapism?\nImage The garden of delights depicted in manuscript, circa 1470.Credit...Getty Images Beyond our Wi-Fi, we don\u2019t have much in the way of connection.\nMany of us are alone and live in small spaces.\nWe lack the distractions we\u2019re accustomed to and the routines we rely on.\nBut some of the most famous self-portraiture resulted from dearth of resources.\nRembrandt was his own subject in large part because he couldn\u2019t afford model.\nFrida Kahlo began painting herself when she was unwell and bedridden and all she could see was mirror.\nWhen Vincent Van Gogh found himself without models, he looked to himself: \u201cIf can manage to paint the coloring of my own head,\u201d he wrote to his brother, \u201cwhich is not to be done without some difficulty, shall likewise be able to paint the heads of other good souls, men and women.\u201d\nThe nude human form as subject of art dates back tens of thousands of years to explicit cave carvings and woolly mammoth tusk-ivory sculpture: Though headless and small enough to wear as pendant, the \u201cVenus of Hohle Fels\u201d has huge, gravity-defying breasts and some semblance of vagina.\nShe might be 40,000 years old.\nBut nude self-portraiture, especially of women by women wresting free from the male gaze to play both artist and muse, didn\u2019t become popular until the beginning of the 20th century.\nImage The \u201cVenus

history at Willamette University, told me, \u201cbut this was probably because he lacked model.\u201d\nWe all know some of the iconic 20th-century images of the scantily clad, including Frida Kahlo\u2019s tragic painting \u201cThe Broken Column\u201d and the photograph of 22-year-old Diane Arbus in her underwear, head cocked as she watches her own reflection.\nImage Frida Kahlo painted

also mentions the photographer Hannah Wilke, who made career of often nude self-portraiture straight through to her final harrowing exhibition \u201cIntra-Venus,\u201d photographs of her face and body ravaged by the lymphoma that would kill her.\nDrawn with crayons, \u201cSelf-Portrait Facing Death\u201d is Picasso\u2019s analogous end-of-life work.\n\u201cSix Self Portraits\u201d is Andy Warhol\u2019s.\nMany artists, not just painters and photographers, leave final selfie as sort of last will and testament: Sylvia Plath published her autobiographical novel \u201cThe Bell Jar\u201d shortly before ending her own life.\nWhile the poet Agha Shahid Ali was dying, he wrote these haunting lines: \u201cAnd I, Shahid, only am escaped to tell thee God sobs in my arms.\u201d\nDavid Bowie\u2019s last song, \u201cLazaru ,\u201d begins, \u201cLook up here, I\u2019m in heaven.\u201d\nIn \u201cRiding With Death,\u201d one of Jean-Michel Basquiat\u2019s last paintings before his fatal drug overdose, naked brown-skinned man rides skeleton like horse.\nImage Pablo Picasso\u2019s \u201cSelf Portrait Facing Death,\u201d 1972.\nCredit...Fine Art Images/Art Resource Though it might require bit of squinting to see pandemic-era nude selfie- snapping on par with Basquiat, geniuses hold no monopoly on the instinct to self-preserve.\nOr on the yearning to be witnessed.\nSending nude selfie is request to be witnessed not objectively, but through rose-tinted or smooth-filtered lenses.\n\u201cWhen choose to be seen in this way,\u201d Kat said, \u201cI\u2019m taking an empowered action to receive what we all desire, and what we desire even more now in Covid times: witness to our own vulnerability, our most private truth.\u201d\nIn \u201cThe Nude: Study in Ideal Form,\u201d Kenneth Clark distinguishes \u201cnude\u201d from \u201cnaked,\u201d the latter implying an unwanted lack of clothing: \u201cThe word \u2018nude,\u2019 on the other hand,\u201d he writes, \u201ccarries, in educated usage, no uncomfortable overtone.\nThe vague image it projects into the mind is not of huddled and defenseless body, but of balanced, prosperous, and confident body: the body re-formed.\u201d\nImage \u201cWoman Combing Her Hair\u201d by Wladyslaw Slewinski, 1897.Credit...Jacek Swiderski/Photographic Studio of the National Museum, Krakow, Poland In these disorienting times, we are psychologically naked, but our nudes are aspirational: We are breasts propped on pillows and Facetuned.\nWe are headless, proof that we\u2019re not overthinking or panicking.\nWe are free, cast in single ray of sunlight, not stuck inside with vitamin deficiency.\nWe are taking risk at time when we are not allowed to take risks, baring our bodies with no guaranteed reaction.\nWe hit send and hold our breaths, silently asking until we receive the reply, am safe am safe am safe?
