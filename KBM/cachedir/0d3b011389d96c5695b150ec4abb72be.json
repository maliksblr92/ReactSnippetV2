Women prefer 'ethical' porn but are they getting it?\nWhile there seems to be porn for every kink, the majority is made for white, male, straight audience.\nWikimedia Commons: Larry Knowles CC By 2.0 Dr Ashton says in her research the women who enjoyed porn said they were put off if they thought anyone involved in the production wasn't giving full consent.\nSome said they tried to source \"ethical porn\", but few were prepared to pay, preferring accessing porn for free online.\nSecret sex lives of Gen Z: don't believe the hysteria We're told mixed messages about how Gen compares to other generations when it comes to getting it on, but is it really anyone's business?\nRead more It's not easy to verify how the porn you're watching was made, especially if you're not paying anyone for it.\nAnd Dr Ashton says some people \"turn off\" their ethics and moral thoughts when they're engaged with porn.\n\"It may not be something that people are aware that the content that you're actually consuming when you masturbate, and when you're experiencing sexual pleasure, that's actually pairing with reward in your brain that will reinforce what you're aroused to, and the sort of things that you associate with your sexuality, it actually has quite profound impact,\" she says.\nDr Tyler says while there is lot of variation in porn, with producers catering to all sorts of kinks and subgenres, the vast majority is made with straight male audience in mind.\nThis skews the content so that even when it's ostensibly lesbian sex being shown, it's being shown for male viewer.\nExplaining active consent Many of us are still getting consent wrong.\nBut when active consent is done right, it can help us get out of our heads and into the game and that means better sex.\nRead more She says porn has been so normalised in our society that some people find it more embarrassing to say they don't use it than admitting to accessing it, and the demand for \"ethical\" porn is part of that normalisation.\n\"Why is there desperation for there to be an ethical porn, rather than the question of what would sexuality look like without pornography now?\" she says.\n\"It's not food, it's not water, it's not air, it's not exercise.\n\"In post-Me Too era, if we're really talking about sharing equal sexual relations between men and women, cannot see the pornography industry is part of that.\n\"You can't say you're pro-Me Too, and you're pro women's consent, and then still go and masturbate to material that fundamentally subordinates women.\"\nMore open talk about sex could help Both Dr Tyler and Dr Ashton believe more open conversations and better sexual education is needed so young people don't feel they have to turn to porn to learn how to have and enjoy sex.\n\"We just need to equip people with knowledge and with access to information and support services, so that they can figure out how to be embracing their sexuality in way that works with them, and having pleasurable, happy, consensual relationship,\" Dr Ashton says.\nPosted 23 FebFebruary 2020, updated 24 FebFebruary 2020 Share Facebook Twitter Article share options Share this on Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Send this by Email Messenger Copy link WhatsApp Related Stories Self-pleasure equals better sex.\nHere's how to get started analysis 'I watch porn with dinner': Five lessons learnt from Australia's raunchy obsession Can you stop kids from watching online porn?\nIs the porn you are watching ethical?\nopinion What we get wrong when we talk about 'porn' 'Sex shouldn't be endured': Why in women experience painful sex Faking orgasms could be contributing to the orgasm gap Most young Aussies are sexting, but there are ways to do it safely The typical victim of 'revenge porn' probably isn't who you think it is Am being unfaithful if fantasise about other people during sex?\nHow porn can be positive force in your relationship Sexual Identity, Sexual Activity, Sexuality, Pornography Back to top ABC Life ABC Life helps you navigate life's challenges and choices so you can stay on top of the things that matter to you.\nMore from ABC We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn and work.\nSections Food Money Travel Style Family Work Wellbeing Sex Relationships Entertainment Home Garden Video Connect with ABC Life Instagram YouTube Facebook Twitter Subscribe to our newsletter Your information is handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.\nEmail address Subscribe Editorial Policies Accessibility Help Contact Us Privacy Policy Terms of Use 2020 ABC [Feb]: February\n"}
