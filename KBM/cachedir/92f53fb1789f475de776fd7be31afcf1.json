heard retired physician comment at lecture, \u201cIn the media, older people\u2019s sex is literally joke.\u201d\nThat is unfortunate.\nSex is fundamental part of our human nature at any age.\nIt is not disease to be controlled or an aberrant behavior that must be managed.\nam an economist, so my immediate thought is whether the market can help seniors\u2019 sex lives.\nViagra has of course helped many men, though libido enhancers for women have been less successful.\nThe sex toy industry is big one, but it has blind spot when it comes to seniors.\nPerhaps the market is failing seniors.\nThe subject of seniors and sex is also dominated by medical framework filled with problems that have to be fixed, according to Northern Arizona University psychological researcher Dr. Emily Patch, who recently spoke on the subject at the Sedona International Film Festival.\nAtrophied vaginas, male impotence, incontinence and cancer are some of the major topics.\nSex and the senior citizen is considered story about decline.\nFor younger people, by contrast, the focus is on fulfillment, happiness and bonding.\nThat doesn\u2019t make economic sense.\nSex and intimacy are just as relevant for older people as for youth.\nbetter understanding of senior sexuality and relationships would go long way to help elders deal with loneliness and financial problems, both of which increase with age.\nPairing up could help people share not only their elder years but also their expenses.\nToday In: Retirement Caregiving In America: The Strain, The Pain, The Emotional Drain Recession Hits Those Facing Health, Other Challenges Especially Hard SBA Clarifies Certification Requirements Today For Paycheck Protection Program Borrowers Sex for seniors is good thing\u2014but it doesn\u2019t get enough positive attention Some surveys indicate seniors are sexually active but not in ways had imagined.\nDespite the evidence elders experience lust and satisfaction from their partners, for too long, research on older people\u2019s sexuality has been spotty.\nWhen Dr. Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s and Masters and Johnson in the late 1950s began their pioneering research on sexuality, average life expectancy at birth was well under 70 and the probability of good health after 65 was also much lower.\nPolitics has also stood in the way of good research.\nConservative politicians have stymied sex research at every turn, and large publicly funded surveys that covered sexuality were cut to smaller sample sizes, drastically reducing the number of older people covered in the sex research literature.\nYet in recent years there has been more research into sexuality among seniors and long-term partners.\nIn one recent study, researchers examined people who said they were \u201cmadly in love\u201d with their long-term partners, with relationships averaging 21 years.\nBrain scans of the participants found they had activated regions in the dopamine-rich regions of the brain, similar to what teenagers would have about their new loves.\nWhat was surprising to researchers was that an area deep in the brain stem that is location for serotonin also lit up.\nThose aren\u2019t the same elements characteristic of younger relationships.\nWith well-loved, long-term partner, sex can have the same neural reward-value as new romance\u2014or better.\nWhat\u2019s more, serotonin and dopamine are important factors in combatting depression and loneliness.\nworry about the costs and hidden inequities embedded in the social ignorance about sex and intimacy in old age.\nBut Professor Patch, in her Sedona lecture, did offer hope to individuals.\nShe recommended individual counseling, especially from couples or sex therapist, as resource that could help seniors needing help understanding their roles and needs.\nsuspect older people in good relationships think it is matter of luck or mystery that they are having sex.\nHow to improve sexual relationship or find supportive intimate partner is black box, and it may help to have professional counselor to consult.\nBut it is much easier for the well-educated and well-insured to get access to relationship counselors than it is for most others.\nIt would seem that older people who manage to improve their relationships or use dating services and apps are typically well-educated and well-to-do.\nDemocratizing sex and wellbeing among seniors We need to go beyond the market in order to democratize intimacy and sex for seniors.\nHere are some ways we could move forward: The Medicare Wellness Exam was developed to ask all patients coming into Medicare about subjects like fall risk, depression, or physical and mental abuse in their relationships.\nThis exam should also ask about sex and intimacy.\nRight now it does not.\nMedicare covers visits with psychologists, but mostly excludes marriage counseling.\nFor lower-income groups, books can help work through various communication issues in relationships.\nFor learning how to have open conversations that avoid resentment and anger, Professor Patch recommends Dance of Anger: Woman's Guide To Changing The Patterns Of Intimate Relationships.\nAlong with age discrimination and ageism we need to change the media and culture representation of sex and seniors.\nWe need more places where senior sex treated with respect in the media.\nWe need changes in medical education on sex, intimacy, and age to stop it from being regarded as abnormal or nonexistent.\nThere is only limited quality research that influences medical education and in general, there is only no enough research on the sex lives of older people.\nThis lack of medical knowledge into sexuality is general problem: medical students in recent study performed below passing rate in majority of sex health knowledge categories.\nWhat about changes in sexual orientation when sex ratios in senior communities?\nWe know when there is an abundance of one sex over the other\u2014in prisons or boarding schools, for example\u2014you find men who don\u2019t live homosexual lives sometimes engaged in deep homosexual relationships.\nThis could be true about sex ratios for older women as well.\nAssisted-living facilities could have regular presentations on sex and intimacy.\nCollege dorms have sex counselors.\nbet if properly marketed, senior citizen communities would have niche.\nBut sex and intimacy shouldn\u2019t be just for rich elders.\nThere is trend of senior homes on college campuses targeted at the affluent.\nPersonnel in Medicaid-funded senior citizen homes need training in the area.\nHappy Valentine\u2019s Day\u2014make it count!\nFollow me on Twitter.\nTeresa Ghilarducci joined The New School in 2008 after 25 years as professor of economics at the
