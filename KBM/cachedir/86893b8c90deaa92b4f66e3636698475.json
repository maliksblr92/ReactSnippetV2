When most people try to look into the secret society\u2019s history, they find themselves in Germany with the Enlightenment-era Order of the Illuminati.\nIt was Bavarian secret society, founded in 1776, for intellectuals to privately group together and oppose the religious and elitist influence over daily life.\nIt included several well-known progressives at the time but, along with the Freemasons, they found themselves gradually outlawed by conservative and Christian critics and the group faded out of existence.\nFilms like Angels and Demons have brought the concept of the Illuminati into popular consciousness Credit: Alamy That is, until the 1960s.\nThe Illuminati that we\u2019ve come to hear about today is hardly influenced by the Bavarians at all, as learned from author and broadcaster David Bramwell, man who has dedicated himself to documenting the origins of the myth.\nInstead, an era of counter-culture mania, LSD and interest in Eastern philosophy is largely responsible for the group\u2019s totally unsubstantiated modern incarnation.\nIt all began somewhere amid the Summer of Love and the hippie phenomenon, when small, printed text emerged: Principia Discordia.\nThe book was, in nutshell, parody text for parody faith Discordianism conjured up by enthusiastic anarchists and thinkers to bid its readers to worship Eris, goddess of chaos.\nThe Discordian movement was ultimately collective that wished to cause civil disobedience, practical jokes and hoaxes The text itself never amounted to anything more than counter-culture curiosity, but one of the tenets of the faith that such miscreant activities could bring about social change and force individuals to question the parameters of reality was immortalised by one writer, Robert Anton Wilson.\nIt\u2019s an idealistic means of getting people to wake up to the suggested realities that they inhabit David Bramwell, author According to Bramwell, Wilson and one of the authors of the Principia Discordia, Kerry Thornley, \u201cdecided that the world was becoming too authoritarian, too tight, too closed, too controlled\u201d. They wanted to bring chaos back into society to shake things up, and \u201cthe way to do that was to spread disinformation.\nTo disseminate misinformation through all portals through counter culture, through the mainstream media, through whatever means.\nAnd they decided they would do that initially by telling stories about the Illuminati.\u201d\nAt the time, Wilson worked for the men\u2019s magazine Playboy.\nHe and Thornley started sending in fake letters from readers talking about this secret, elite organisation called the Illuminati.\nThen they would send in more letters to contradict the letters they had just written.\nJay is one famous hip hop star to raise their hands into the alleged Illuminati triangle symbol at concerts Credit: Alamy \u201cSo, the concept behind this was that if you give enough contrary points of view on story, in theory idealistically the population at large start looking at these things and think, \u2018hang on minute\u2019,\u201d says Bramwell.\n\u201cThey ask themselves, \u2018Can trust how the information is presented to me?\u2019\nIt\u2019s an idealistic means of getting people to wake up to the suggested realities that they inhabit which of course didn\u2019t happen quite in the way they were hoping.\u201d\nThe chaos of the Illuminati myth did indeed travel far and wide Wilson and another Playboy writer wrote The Illuminatus!\nTrilogy which attributed the \u2018cover-ups\u2019 of our times such as who shot John Kennedy to the Illuminati.\nThe books became such surprise cult success that they were made into stage play in Liverpool, launching the careers of British actors Bill Nighy and Jim Broadbent.\nToday, it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most widely punted conspiracy theories British electronic band The KLF also called themselves The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, named after the band of Discordians that infiltrate the Illuminati in Wilson\u2019s trilogy as they were inspired by the religion\u2019s anarchic ideology.\nThen, an Illuminati role-playing card game appeared in 1975 which imprinted its mystical world of secret societies onto whole generation.\nToday, it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most widely punted conspiracy theories; even celebrities like Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 have taken on the symbolism of the group themselves, raising their hands into the Illuminati triangle at concerts.\nIt\u2019s hardly instigated the mind-blowing epiphany the realisation that it\u2019s all fake which the proponents of Discordianism had originally intended.\nThe 60s culture of mini-publishers and zines seems terrifically distant now from today\u2019s globalised, hyper-connected internet, and it has undeniably been the internet\u2019s propensity to share and propagate Illuminati rumours on websites like 4chan and Reddit that has brought the idea the fame it has today.\nBut we live in world that is full of conspiracy theories and, more importantly, conspiracy theory believers; in 2015, political scientists discovered that about half of the general public in the USA endorse at least one conspiracy theory.\nThese include anything from the Illuminati to the Obama \u2018birther\u2019 conspiracy, or the widely held belief that 9/11 was an inside job carried out by US intelligence services.\nConspiracy theorists believe signs on the US dollar bill point to Illuminati influence Credit: Alamy \u201cThere\u2019s no one profile of conspiracy theorist,\u201d says Viren Swami, professor of social psychology at Anglia Ruskin University.\n\u201cThere are different perspectives of why people believe in these theories, and they\u2019re not necessarily mutually exclusive so the simplest form of explanation is that people who believe in conspiracy theories are suffering from some sort of psychopathology.\u201d\nAnother conclusion researchers have drawn to is that these theories could provide rational ways of understanding events that are confusing or threatening to self esteem.\n\u201cThey give you very simple explanation,\u201d adds Swami, who published research in 2016 that found believers in conspiracy theories are more likely to be suffering from stressful experiences than non- believers.\nOther psychologists also discovered last year that people with higher levels of education are less likely to believe in conspiracy theories.\nThe big change now is that politicians, particularly Donald Trump, are starting to use conspiracies to mobilise support Viren Swami, Anglia Ruskin University The picture that this paints of modern America is dark one, especially for Swami who has seen change in who normally promotes conspiracy material.\n\u201cParticularly in South Asia, conspiracy theories have been mechanism for the government to control the people.\nIn the West, it\u2019s typically been the opposite; they\u2019ve been the subject of people who lack agency, who lack power, and it\u2019s their lacking of power that gives rise to conspiracy theories to challenge the government.\nLike with 9/11.\nIf people lack power, conspiracy theories can sow the seeds of social protest and allow people to ask questions.\n\u201cThe big change now is that politicians, particularly Donald Trump, are starting to use conspiracies to mobilise support.\u201d\nThe 45th President of the United States was notorious \u201cbirther\u201d, regularly speaking to the media about how President Obama wasn\u2019t really born in Hawaii.\nHe also accused various US states of voter fraud after the 2016 election and his campaign team were responsible for propagating now debunked fabricated stories such as Pizzagate and the Bowling Green Massacre.\nasked Swami if he thought that this shift in conspiracy theory usage could affect politics long term.\n\u201cPeople could become disengaged with mainstream politics if they believe in conspiracy theories,\u201d said Swami.\n\u201cThey\u2019re much more likely to engage with fringe politics.\nThey\u2019re also much more likely to engage with racist, xenophobic and extremist views.\u201d\nUS President Donald Trump has brought conspiracy theories into the political mainstream Credit: Alamy The idea of an untouchable, secretive elite must resonate with people that feel left behind and powerless; Trump said he wanted to represent these people, especially the once-powerful industrial landscape of America\u2019s Rust Belt.\nYet instead of feeling better represented in the halls of power by non-politician like themselves and theoretically being less likely to feel powerless and vulnerable to conspiracies it seems like some in America are more likely to believe in stories like the Illuminati more than ever before.\n\u201cIf Wilson was alive today, he\u2019d be part delighted, part shocked\u201d, says David Bramwell.\n\u201cAs far as they thought in the 60s, culture was little too tight.\nAt present, it feels like things are loose.\n\u201cPerhaps more stability will come as people fight against \u2018fake news\u2019 and propaganda.\nWe\u2019re starting to understand how social media is feeding us ideas we want to believe.\nBetween internet forums, nods in popular culture and humankind\u2019s generally uninhibited capacity for imagination, today\u2019s truth-finders and fact checkers might debunk the Illuminati myth for good.\nRead about our approach to external linking.\n"}
