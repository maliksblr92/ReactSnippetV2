Emilio Flores/Getty Images LOS ANGELES As states and employers furiously develop plans to safely reopen workplaces in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, they\u2019re grappling with what seems like an endless list of questions: where to test, who to test, and how often to test for the virus?\nFurther complicating matters are issues of workers\u2019 privacy, geography, politics, science, and cost.\nIt\u2019s difficult mandate.\nBut there is one place to look for guidance the adult film industry.\nSince the late 1990s, when an outbreak of HIV infections threatened to shutter the multibillion-dollar industry, the mainstream porn community has implemented procedures that require all performers to be tested for HIV and host of other sexually transmitted infections every 14 days before they can be cleared to work.\nAny HIV-positive test leads to an immediate shutdown of all U.S. sets, followed by detailed contact tracing before sets can reopen.\nWhile not perfect, those in the industry say the nationwide PASS program works to protect thousands of performers, ensures safer workplaces, and curtails the spread of disease.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think could be in this industry without it.\nThat would be insane.\nBareback sex with strangers 20 times month?\nIt would be like the most dangerous job in the world,\u201d said Lance Hart, gay and straight adult film performer and independent pornographer in Las Vegas who runs the production companies Sweet Femdom and Man Up Films.\nadvertisement In the 20 years it has been in place, PASS has met, and overcome, many of the same challenges that any large-scale coronavirus testing program might encounter, from issues of keeping databases of private medical information secure, preventing the forging of test results, dealing with false positive results, and educating workers about the need for repeated testing to keep workplaces safe.\nThose devising strategies to reopen workplaces and the larger economy during the coronavirus pandemic say their plans would involve, at their core, processes of rigorous testing, isolation, and contact tracing similar to those used in the adult film industry.\nNewsletters Sign up

for what we are trying to do with Covid,\u201d said Ashish Jha, physician who directs Harvard University\u2019s Global Health Institute and has been calling for widespread national testing to contain the coronavirus.\n\u201cThe adult film industry teaches us that as proof of concept, this can work.\nWe just have to scale it up.\u201d\nadvertisement Lance Hart, an adult film performer who also runs two production companies.\nNikki Hearts Jha said he could envision program similar to PASS where Covid-19 test results are put into secure database that could be checked to verify whether people had recently tested negative for the virus.\n\u201cYou could imagine TSA verifying someone had tested negative before they were allowed on flight,\u201d he said.\n\u201cTesting is particularly important for areas that are high risk, like airplanes or meatpacking plants.\u201d\nWhile it did not cite the adult film industry, \u201cNational Covid-19 Testing Action Plan\u201d released by the Rockefeller Foundation last month included the creation of an \u201cinfection database\u201d that could be accessed by employers, schools, TSA, and those scanning tickets for entry into sports or music venues.\n\u201cWhat the adult film industry has produced has worked, and really could be the kind of tool we need,\u201d Jha said.\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t get distracted because it\u2019s from business they don\u2019t approve of.\u201d\nMike Stabile, communications director for the Free Speech Coalition, the adult entertainment trade association that runs PASS, said the adult film industry understands \u201cbetter than most the discussion that has to happen for businesses to reopen.\u201d\nYet for all of that expertise, it would be hard to imagine the Trump administration, or state politicians, reaching out to the porn industry for guidance.\nStabile said that while he has not been contacted by any government officials, he would have plenty of advice to share.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an ongoing process.\nIt\u2019s not going to be binary open or shut,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not as heavy lift as people think.\nThis is something that\u2019s doable.\u201d\nStabile, who is closely following coronavirus news, feels most people are unaware of the need for repeat testing that is standard in his industry.\n\u201cWhen you look at the world at large, there\u2019s an idea you\u2019ll be tested once and then go back to work, but with coronavirus, it\u2019s not that simple.\nWe\u2019re looking at series of regular tests until this gets under control,\u201d he said.\nRepeat testing will be necessary for the coronavirus, too, because like with HIV there is so much asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus, said Elizabeth \u201cBetz\u201d Halloran, professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington who directs the Center for Inference and Dynamics of Infectious Diseases at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to keep testing, maybe every 10 days.\nWe need simpler tests that people can just do at home,\u201d said Halloran, who envisions low-cost \u201c10-pack\u201d of tests for home use.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t sit around for 18 months waiting for vaccine.\nWe have to find way out without pharmaceuticals, and that\u2019s repeat testing, taking people out of circulation, and then contact tracing, so it\u2019s an interesting analogy,\u201d said Halloran, who is working with colleagues to model plan where the disease could be kept at levels that would not exceed health care capacity and that would require quarantining less than 10% of people.\nRelated: \u2018We need an army\u2019: Hiring of coronavirus trackers seen as key to curbing disease spread Performers say they have lot to teach the rest of the post-Covid-19 world.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already used to working in an environment of risk.\nThat\u2019s something the rest of the normal world is just learning to do,\u201d said Lotus Lain, bisexual adult film actress who works with Stabile\u2019s group as an advocate for other performers.\nLain said the porn sets she works on are extremely clean and precautions are taken to limit infectious-disease risk.\n\u201cAll of the things people are looking for right now gloves, masks, alcohol wipes we have all those things on sets.\nIt\u2019s standard operating procedure,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI hope other industries look to our industry not just to learn, but to credit us as well.\u201d\nAdult-film actress Lotus Lain LegendOne AIDS experts say the testing program within the adult film industry provides insight into how we might build national testing programs to safeguard workplaces, but also helps illustrate the many challenges that lie ahead, in part because the coronavirus has proved so contagious.\n\u201cHIV is our prior pandemic.\nSurely we can learn from that,\u201d said Robert Gallo, the virologist who co-discovered HIV and now directs the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nBut Gallo said preventing the spread of HIV in the film industry is far more tractable problem than reining in the novel coronavirus.\n\u201cYou have to deal with every virus differently,\u201d said Gallo, who in 2011 co- founded the Global Virus Network, consortium working to prevent and eradicate viral disease.\nHIV, he said, was difficult to contain because symptoms don\u2019t occur for years, but it was also harder to transmit.\n\u201cThis virus is viciously infectious,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s as infectious as anything I\u2019ve ever heard of.\u201d\nOne key to containment, he added, would be to take time now, before widespread testing begins, to ensure tests are highly accurate and avoid the false positive results caused by cross reactions with other common coronaviruses.\nPamina Gorbach, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at UCLA\u2019s Fielding School of Public Health, has studied the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in the adult film industry.\nShe says the testing program is step in the right direction to protect the health of performers, but thinks there is room for improvement.\nGorbach\u2019s 2017 study of 360 adult film workers showed 24% of performers were infected with either chlamydia or gonorrhea.\nOne-third of those infections were found in the throat or rectum, she said, undetectable by the urine tests the industry uses to screen for sexually transmitted infections and serving as reservoirs for ongoing transmission.\nThe findings show that testing protocols need to be carefully thought through, she said.\nChlamydia and gonorrhea, for example, can be transmitted within the 14-day repeat testing window that was chosen because it works to prevent HIV transmission.\nThe film industry does not think Gorbach\u2019s study accurately assesses the effectiveness of its testing program because the study enrolled wide variety of performers, including those who do not participate in routine testing, and also recruited from pool of performers who were actively seeking treatment for infections.\nThe study also found more than 20% of film workers were self-treating without medical advice when they had symptoms, hoping to shorten the time they might miss work.\nGorbach said she feared the same thing could happen with Covid-19, with people misusing or overusing inappropriate treatments in an attempt to cure themselves or mask symptoms so they won\u2019t miss work.\nPorn performers don\u2019t get paid when they can\u2019t get to sets, just like other workers without paid sick leave.\nGorbach said she did see clear lessons that coronavirus testing programs could take from the film industry, including thinking about how to address people who \u201cfloat,\u201d or work at multiple locations that have vastly different standards for screening or protection.\n\u201cPeople in nursing homes float, just like the adult film industry.\nThey float, they work at multiple places with different rules and standards,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf one place they work screens for infection and one doesn\u2019t, they can take the infection from one place to another.\u201d\nRelated: Covid-19 spreads too fast for traditional contact tracing.\nNew digital tools could help The film industry deals with this through frequent testing, and Stabile said most performers won\u2019t work with untested partners.\nWhile the testing program is voluntary, Stabile said clear test results are requirement on most mainstream sets.\nWho would pay for tests is also an issue.\nIn the film industry, performers generally pay the roughly $150 testing fee to be cleared to work.\nPublic health officials argue that workers, especially low-wage workers, should not bear the brunt of coronavirus-testing costs.\n\u201cIn public health, we try to reduce barriers to prevent the spread of disease, especially economic barriers,\u201d said Angela Bazzi, an assistant professor of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health who has studied the health of sex workers in Mexico, Kenya, Ghana, and Boston.\n\u201cIf we place this burden on individuals, that\u2019s worrisome.\u201d\nThe geography of testing is also concern; when permits and condoms were required on film sets in Los Angeles, many producers moved filming to less restrictive locations.\nEmployers might do the same, experts said, to avoid coronavirus testing programs they deem costly or onerous.\nBazzi said it was fascinating to think about what could be learned from program that increased safety for actors in the adult film industry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s informative,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve clearly gone through decision-making process.\u201d\nBut she added that coronavirus testing would likely be far trickier for practical reasons.\nAdult film testing started more than decade after the HIV outbreak, and only after years of research to improve HIV tests.\nCoronavirus tests are still work in progress.\n\u201cIn HIV, we saw this progression of tests that took decades, and there are still new tests being developed,\u201d Bazzi said.\n\u201cWith coronavirus, there are still lot of unknowns with testing.\u201d\nPolitics will also likely play role in coronavirus testing programs, if the film industry is an indicator.\nThe testing program continually comes under fire from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, whose leaders think testing does not do enough to prevent on-set HIV transmission and that condoms should be required.\nAnother issue has been simmering argument over whether HIV- positive performers who have such low levels of the virus that they cannot transmit it should be allowed to participate in filming.\nFor now, any HIV- positive result, regardless of viral titre, disqualifies performer from being cleared to film in the PASS program.\nNow, fears about sexually transmitted infections have faded into the background as those in the film industry grapple with the coronavirus.\nPerformers can obtain the tests they need to be cleared to work because medical clinics remain open, but Stabile said few were participating, mainly because production is on hold due to the coronavirus.\nPeople can still shoot solo videos, or videos with people they are quarantining with.\nLike many industries, Stabile\u2019s group is trying to determine when and how it could safely resume work.\nLike workers across the country, those in the film industry are feeling the economic pain of loss of work although those who run subscription porn sites say their business is booming during quarantine.\n\u201cMy revenue is through the roof,\u201d said Hart, who, while at home with his wife and four cats, is raising money for makeup artists, production assistants, and other set workers who are struggling.\nFree Speech Coalition task force is meeting twice week by Zoom, grappling with questions like whether they can incorporate Covid-19 in their testing protocols and how to protect camera operators, makeup artists, and other on- set employees that did not require testing before.\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking questions like whether directors and camera people can shoot with N95 masks on,\u201d Stabile said.\n\u201cWe are actively trying to figure out how to make sets safe, and that means coronavirus as well as HIV.\u201d\nThe question is: Can we?\nBy Helen Branswell advertisement Health Covid-19 experts lament
