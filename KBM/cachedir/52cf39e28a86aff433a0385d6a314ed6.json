while not the same as sexual reproduction, this also results in the mixture of genetic traits.\nThe defining characteristic of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes is the difference between the gametes and the binary nature of fertilization.\nMultiplicity of gamete types within species would still be considered form of sexual reproduction.\nChromosomes are passed on from one generation to the next in this process.\nCrossing over and fertilization the recombining of single sets of chromosomes to make new diploid result in the new organism containing different set of genetic traits from either parent.\nIn many organisms, the haploid stage has been reduced to just gametes specialized to recombine and form new diploid organism.\nIn plants the diploid organism produces haploid spores that undergo cell division to produce multicellular haploid organisms known as gametophytes that produce haploid gametes at maturity.\nThese gametes combine to form embryos which develop into new organism.\nThe male gamete, spermatozoon produced in vertebrates within the testes is small cell containing single long flagellum which propels it.[26] Spermatozoa are extremely reduced cells, lacking many cellular components that would be necessary for embryonic development.\nThey are specialized for motility, seeking out an egg cell and fusing with it in process called fertilization.\nFemale gametes are egg cells produced in vertebrates within the ovaries large immobile cells that contain the nutrients and cellular components necessary for developing embryo.[27] Egg cells are often associated with other cells which support the development of the embryo, forming an egg.\nIn mammals, the fertilized embryo instead develops within the female, receiving nutrition directly from its mother.\nAnimals are usually mobile and seek out partner of the opposite sex for mating.\nIn humans and other mammals this male organ is the penis, which enters the female reproductive tract called the vagina to achieve insemination\u2014a process called sexual intercourse.\nThe penis contains tube through which semen fluid containing sperm travels.\nIn female mammals the vagina connects with the uterus, an organ which directly supports the development of fertilized embryo within process called gestation Because of their motility, animal sexual behavior can involve coercive sex.\nTraumatic insemination, for example, is used by some insect species to inseminate females through wound in the abdominal cavity\u2014a process detrimental to the female's health.\nPlants Main article: Plant reproduction Flowers are the sexual organs of flowering plants, usually containing both male and female parts.\nLike animals, plants have specialized male and female gametes.[30] Within seed plants, male gametes are produced by extremely reduced multicellular gametophytes known as pollen.\nThe female gametes of seed plants are contained within ovules; once fertilized by male gametes produced by pollen these form seeds which, like eggs, contain the nutrients necessary for the development of the embryonic plant.\nFemale left and male right cones are the sex organs of pines and other conifers.\nMany plants have flowers and these are the sexual organs of those plants.\nFlowers are usually hermaphroditic, producing both male and female gametes.\nThe female parts, in the center of flower, are the pistils, each unit consisting of carpel, style and stigma.\nOne or more of these reproductive units may be merged to form single compound pistil.\nWithin the carpels are ovules which develop into seeds after fertilization.\nThe male parts of the flower are the stamens: these consist of long filaments arranged between the pistil and the petals that produce pollen in anthers at their tips.\nIn pines and other conifers the sex organs are conifer cones and have male and female forms.\nThe more familiar female cones are typically more durable, containing ovules within them.\nMale cones are smaller and produce pollen which is transported by wind to land in female cones.\nAs with flowers, seeds form within the female cone after pollination.\nBecause plants are immobile, they depend upon passive methods for transporting pollen grains to other plants.\nMany plants, including conifers and grasses, produce lightweight pollen which is carried by wind to neighboring plants.\nOther plants have heavier, sticky pollen that is specialized for transportation by animals.\nThe plants attract these insects or larger animals such as humming birds and bats with nectar-containing flowers.\nThese animals transport the pollen as they move to other flowers, which also contain female reproductive organs, resulting in pollination.\nFungi Main article: Mating in fungi Mushrooms are produced as part of fungal sexual reproduction Most fungi reproduce sexually, having both haploid and diploid stage in their life cycles.\nThese fungi are typically isogamous, lacking male and female specialization: haploid fungi grow into contact with each other and then fuse their cells.\nYeast with the same mating type will not fuse with each other to form diploid cells, only with yeast carrying the other mating type.[32] Many species of higher fungi produce mushrooms as part of their sexual reproduction.\nWithin the mushroom diploid cells are formed, later dividing into haploid spores.\nThe height of the mushroom aids the dispersal of these sexually produced offspring.[ citation needed Sex determination Main article: Sex-determination system Sex helps the spread of advantageous traits through recombination.\nThe diagrams compare evolution of allele frequency in sexual population top and an asexual population bottom The vertical axis shows frequency and the horizontal axis shows time.\nThe alleles a/A and b/B occur at random.\nThe advantageous alleles and B, arising independently, can be rapidly combined by sexual reproduction into the most advantageous combination AB.\nAsexual reproduction takes longer to achieve this combination, because it can only produce AB if arises in an individual which already has B, or vice versa.\nThe biological cause for an organism developing into one sex or the other is called sex determination.\nThe cause may be genetic or non-genetic.\nSometimes intersex individuals are called \"hermaphrodite\"; but, unlike biological hermaphrodites, intersex individuals are unusual cases and are not typically fertile in both male and female aspects.\nGenetic Like humans and other mammals, the common fruit fly has an XY sex- determination system.\nIn genetic sex-determination systems, an organism's sex is determined by the genome it inherits.\nGenetic sex-determination usually depends on asymmetrically inherited sex chromosomes which carry genetic features that influence development; sex may be determined either by the presence of sex chromosome or by how many the organism has.\nGenetic sex-determination, because it is determined by chromosome assortment, usually results in 1:1 ratio of male and female offspring.\nHumans and other mammals have an XY sex-determination system: the chromosome carries factors responsible for triggering male development.\nThe \"default sex,\" in the absence of chromosome, is female-like.\nThus, XX mammals are female and XY are male.\nThe majority of butterflies and moths also have ZW sex-determination system.\nThis is called X0 sex-determination\u2014the indicates the absence of the sex chromosome.\nAll other chromosomes in these organisms are diploid, but organisms may inherit one or two chromosomes.\nThis sex-determination system results in highly biased sex ratios, as the sex of offspring is determined by fertilization rather than the assortment of chromosomes during meiosis.\nNongenetic Clownfishes are initially male; the largest fish in group becomes female Main article: Environmental sex determination For many species, sex is not determined by inherited traits, but instead by environmental factors experienced during development or later in life.\nMany reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination: the temperature embryos experience during their development determines the sex of the organism.\nIn some turtles, for example, males are produced at lower incubation temperatures than females; this difference in critical temperatures can be as little as 1\u20132 \u00b0C. Many fish change sex over the course of their lifespan, phenomenon called sequential hermaphroditism.\nIn clownfish, smaller fish are male, and the dominant and largest fish in group becomes female.\nIn many wrasses the opposite is true\u2014most fish are initially female and become male when they reach certain size.\nSequential hermaphrodites may produce both types of gametes over the course of their lifetime, but at any given point they are either female or male.\nMany animals and some plants have differences between the male and female sexes in size and appearance, phenomenon called sexual dimorphism.\nSex differences in humans include, generally, larger size and more body hair in men; women have breasts, wider hips, and higher body fat percentage.\nIn other species, the differences may be more extreme, such as differences in coloration or bodyweight.\nSexual dimorphisms in animals are often associated with sexual selection\u2014the competition between individuals of one sex to mate with the opposite sex.[43] Antlers in male deer, for example, are used in combat between males to win reproductive access to female deer.\nIn many cases the male of species is larger than the female.\nMammal species with extreme sexual size dimorphism tend to have highly polygynous mating systems\u2014presumably due to selection for success in competition with other males\u2014such as the elephant seals.\nOther examples demonstrate that it is the preference of females that drive sexual dimorphism, such as in the case of the stalk-eyed fly.[44] Other animals, including most insects and many fish, have larger females.\nSee also Sex and gender distinction Sex assignment References 1.\nAngus Stevenson, Maurice Waite 2011 Concise Oxford English Dictionary: Book CD-ROM Set.\nOUP Oxford. p. 1302\\.
