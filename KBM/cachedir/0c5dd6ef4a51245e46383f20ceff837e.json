Incidents of this sort are rarely prosecuted or even labeled rape, part of an institutional attitude which privileges men and sanctions sexual power.\nThis sobering view of sexual life among America's youth is one which some may, despite all evidence, choose to disbelieve.\nYet what cannot be denied or ignored is the struggle by college-aged men and women to define their sexuality in the terms society offers them.\nTaught to deny the feminine and embrace sexual power, as this view suggests, men can see it their natural right to degrade and to assault women.\nAnd women the unwilling victims through their own lack of self esteem or sense of power, may seek social status by attaching themselves to men in power, in this case, the fraternity brothers.\nsource: Nielsen Book Data Subjects Subject Gang rape United States Case studies.\nGreek letter societies Case studies.\nCollege students United States Sexual behavior Case studies.\nBibliographic information Publication date 1990 ISBN 0814779026 alk. paper $19.95 9780814779026 alk. paper Browse related items Start at call number: HV6561 .S25 1990 View full page Librarian view Catkey: 600694 Hours locations My Account Ask us Opt out of analytics System status Stanford Home Maps Directions Search Stanford Emergency Info Terms of Use Privacy Copyright Trademarks Non-Discrimination Accessibility (C) Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305.\n"}
