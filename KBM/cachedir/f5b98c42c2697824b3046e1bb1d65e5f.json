known for reminding us that the technology we surround ourselves with every day could be leading us toward dystopian hellscape where our very humanity may be lost.\nThat isn\u2019t particularly cheery message, and with some episodes, not particularly plausible one.\nThe show doesn\u2019t really provide solutions to the problems it suggests, but normally, it does serve up thought experiments and cautionary tales: \u201cReflect upon your current behaviors,\u201d Brooker seems to be saying, \u201cso we all don\u2019t end up like these sad saps.\u201d\nAnd then there\u2019s the season episode \u201cMetalhead.\u201d\nFrom plot perspective, \u201cMetalhead\u201d could be pitched as Black Mirror \u2019s take on The Terminator distilled down to its simplest form.\nroving robot is hunting woman named Bella Maxine Peake and it will not stop until it has caught her.\nBut this isn\u2019t an ordinary robot; it\u2019s Boston Dynamics-style robot dog, with the sleek design of high-end gadget and relentless variety of tools and tactics at its disposal.\nAs the episode whips by in series of visceral action vignettes, there isn\u2019t any larger takeaway or word of warning to be gleaned.\nIt\u2019s just disturbing reminder that the future is coming, and it will not stop.\nUntil we are dead.\nLike most episodes of Black Mirror \u201cMetalhead\u201d drops into non-specified future without much ceremony or explanation.\nThere\u2019s trio, led by Bella, driving in car on their way to an unspecified destination.\nThey lament how pigs have disappeared from the landscape, taken care of by the \u201cdogs.\u201d\nbrief line of dialogue suggests this future society is one of extreme inequality, and the episode is shot entirely in grainy black and white.\nTaken together, the elements capture the feel of bleak world of have and have-nots.\nTheir goal, it turns out, is to break into warehouse to steal something for dying family member of Bella\u2019s.\nBut after they enter the facility, the robotic dog appears, shoots tracking projectiles into Bella\u2019s crew, and begins killing them.\nIt even takes control of vehicle to force Bella off the road, setting up desperate run across the Scottish moors as she tries to save herself.\nAs piece of action filmmaking, the episode is ruthlessly efficient.\nDirector David Slade American Gods Hannibal hits the gas early and never lets up, capturing Bella\u2019s desperate attempts at escape with v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sensibility, while never blinking away from the dog itself.\nThere\u2019s no time to question whether the creature is practical effect or computer-generated when watching \u201cMetalhead.\u201d\nSlade shoots the robot simply, as if it\u2019s utterly grounded in reality, and whether it\u2019s chasing an escaping van and catching it or tracking Bella through the rocks alongside river, the approach paints the focus on the creature as an unstoppable, visceral threat, creating some of the most tense, cringe-inducing moments in the entire series.\nThe episode is short barely over 41 minutes, including credits but what it packs in can be so unnerving that it\u2019s hard to see how the episode could have stretched any longer without becoming untenable.\nIn an EW interview, Brooker says his original script included behind-the- scenes controller for the dog, which would have made this more of an episode about drone technology than autonomous robots.\nFrankly, \u201cMetalhead\u201d is better off with the cuts he made, which make the dog more alien and terrifying, instead of basically remote-controlled gun.\nPhoto by Jonathan Prime Netflix The visceral, chase-oriented story calls to mind movies like Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1971 debut Duel in which Dennis Weaver was terrorized on the highway by an unseen pursuer in semitruck.\nBut Black Mirror follows its usual technological-threat theme, which adds layer of subtext to the game of cat-and-robot-dog.\nThe robot is replete with features viewers will recognize from their own smartphones and computers: sleep mode, GPS tracking, and what appears to be some sort of over-the-air wireless charging.\nIt\u2019s consumer electronics device designed to kill, weaponizing what we normally think of as forward-thinking, disruptive features.\nIt\u2019s familiar, yet terrifying, primal, yet impossibly advanced.\nAt certain point, the never-ending assault of the dog starts to feel like the relentless, iterative march of technology itself, something that can neither be stopped nor controlled.\nHuman beings may try to outsmart or fool it, as Bella does throughout the episode, but the implication is that humanity has engineered the perfect weapon, and those unlucky enough to wind up on the wrong end of it are doomed.\nThat last idea is driven home in the episode\u2019s final stretch.\nDespite the economic inequality inferred in the opening, Bella runs across luxurious, well-equipped compound that includes clearly rich residents who have met their own untimely demise.\nIt makes the overall menace of the landscape in \u201cMetalhead\u201d even more insidious.\nNot even wealth and privilege are enough to win out in the face of whatever this sinister world holds, and children aren\u2019t saved from its atrocities, either.\nThere is only the relentless push of technology.\nWhile most of the backstory remains vague in \u201cMetalhead,\u201d it\u2019s easy to imagine Brooker having company like Amazon in mind when portraying the episode\u2019s mysterious warehouse full of goods.\nPackage-delivering drones aren\u2019t much of leap from patrolling robot dogs, after all, and warehouse where humans are no longer needed thanks to robotic advances would be tidy explanation for the economic ruin that appears to have afflicted the characters in \u201cMetalhead.\u201d\nBut the episode isn\u2019t that literal, and its implied scope is much larger.\nSome Black Mirror episodes in the past have critiqued social media culture, or the dangers of augmented reality, but by keeping this episode\u2019s story so streamlined, Brooker is able to spin \u201cMetalhead\u201d into something much larger.\nThe episode\u2019s final shot is gut punch that suggests Brooker wasn\u2019t talking about robots or shipping, but the loss of human innocence all in the name of \u201cprogress.\u201d\nImage: Netflix Depending on your point of view, Black Mirror is either at its best or its worst when it is truly hopeless, laying bare its cynical views on technology and humanity.\n\u201cMetalhead\u201d is an episode firmly designed for the first camp.\nBeyond the thrills of the chase itself, there is no hope for happy ending in \u201cMetalhead.\u201d\nThere is only the final ending.\n\u201cMETALHEAD\u201d RATINGS Relevance: This episode doesn\u2019t grab hold of specific cultural moment or technological trend as much as other episodes do.\nThis is about the big picture.\nWe recognize it as connected to cutting-edge robotics work being done today, and by suggesting that robotics work will eventually be weaponized to serve an elite owner class by killing off any have-nots who dare put toe out of line, Black Mirror creates larger commentary on technology itself.\nBut the episode doesn\u2019t scream out relevance the way an near-future episode about social media oversaturation would.\nAesthetics: The black-and-white photography is refreshing change of pace, and it\u2019s worth marveling over the seamless integration of the robotic dog into the natural landscape.\nFor show that probably relies too heavily on transparent screens in every direction, and the Gattaca -esque mindset of \u201cLet\u2019s shoot in real, pseudo-futuristic buildings and call it day,\u201d the primal, almost analog look and feel of \u201cMetalhead\u201d is standout across the entire season.\nSquirm Factor: What\u2019s the maximum score we can give to something like this?\nWhatever the maximum is, take that, and double it.\nMy wife and were literally squirming on the couch while watching this episode, and even thinking about certain sequences now, my toes start curling up.\n\u201cMetalhead\u201d is so tense, it\u2019s almost not any fun at all.\nBut then again, that kind of dichotomy is what makes Black Mirror so mesmerizing in the first place.\nIn This Stream Black Mirror: breaking down the series'
