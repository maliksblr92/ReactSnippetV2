Such viral videos were the inspiration for \"Metalhead,\" gripping Black Mirror episode which began streaming Friday.\nBelow, series creator Charlie Brooker answers few of our burning questions.\nThe set-up: It's post-apocalyptic future where robot dogs are hunting human survivors, including our protagonist Maxine Peake who faces an unrelenting and surprisingly capable pursuer across barren landscape.\nThe robot is full of lethal tricks, ranging from operating car to re-charging from the sun.\nYet perhaps the eeriest moment is when the overturned robot simply pushes itself back upright to regain its footing -- as that's something we've actually seen robots do in Boston Dynamics online videos.\nIt's perhaps the most chilling vision yet of the well-worn killer robot trope since the robot's mechanics overlay so closely with real footage we've seen.\nAdding to the tale's mood and originality, the episode was shot entirely in black and white by director David Slade American Gods Hard Candy with soundtrack lifting orchestral cues from The Shining.\nHere's the episode's trailer, which doesn't give much away: If you don't want any spoilers, however, be sure you watch the episode before continuing.\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Loved this episode.\nIt 's inspired assume by those Boston Dynamics videos on YouTube crossed with Night of the Living Dead?\nCHARLIE BROOKER That's actually scarily correct.\nIt was from watching Boston Dynamics videos, but crossed with -- have you seen the film All Is Lost?\nwanted to do story where there was almost no dialogue.\nAnd with those videos, there's something very creepy watching them where they get knocked over, and they look sort of pathetic laying there, but then they slowly manage to get back up.\nHere's video of an actual Boston Dynamics dog, one of their sleek newer versions You never filled in questions such as: How did the robots take over?\nIs anybody controlling them?\nDid you figure that out and is there any backstory you can share?\nWe sort of deliberately decided not to flesh out lot of the backstory.\nOriginally in my first draft, we also showed human operator operating the dog robot from across the ocean at his house.\nThere was bit liked where he leaves the control unit while the robot is watching her while she's up in the tree and he goes and gives his kids bath.\nBut it felt bit weird and too on-the-nose.\nIt kind of felt superfluous.\nWe deliberately pared it back and did very simple story.\nWhy did you shoot black and white?\nWas it just to be evocative?\nOr did it also save on CG costs to render the dog?\nThat was the director, David Slade.\nHe wanted it to be black and white.\nLike you say it does put you in mind of old horror movies and it fit with the sparse, pared-back nature of the story.\ndon't think it saved money on CG.\nIt felt like something hadn't seen before -- doing lots of CG in black and white.\nIn the end, the crate sought by the humans is revealed to contain teddy bears.\nOther than the lost humanity and possible callback to another action-filled episode, \"White Bear\"? The bears were actually yellow, but because it was shot in black and white, they're white bears -- was happy with that being little Easter egg.\nWe went back and forth on what should be in that warehouse.\nOriginally in the script, it just said \"toys.\"\nThe idea was box of toys for dying child.\nDavid wanted it to be the only soft and comforting thing that we saw in the entire piece.\nHe wanted it to be something softer and more immediately comforting.\nSo we went for bears.\nWhich is probably just as well because crate full of fidget spinners would have been ridiculous.\nEntertainment Weekly is registered trademark of Meredith Corporation All Rights Reserved.\nEntertainment Weekly may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.\nOffers may be subject to change without notice.\nPrivacy Policythis link opens in new tab Terms of Servicethis link opens in new tab Ad Choicesthis link opens in new tab California Do Not Sellthis link opens modal window Web Accessibilitythis link opens in new tab (C) Copyright All rights reserved.\nPrinted from https://ew.com Close View image Black Mirror creator explains that 'Metalhead' robot nightmare this link is to an external site that may or may not meet accessibility guidelines.\n"}
