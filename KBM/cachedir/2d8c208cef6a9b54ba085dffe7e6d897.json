July 1999 by inframan See all my reviews When first saw this movie on the indie channel, taped it.\nimmediately watched it again, totally stunned by the extent of energy, imagination, ideas, images with which was being blasted.\nTalk about universal masterpiece!\nThis movie should be required viewing on every screen, large small in the US.\nWe Americans lead such narrow sheltered lives; we are so eager to see things in black white, to have our opinions dictated by columnists newscasters.\nThis movie should take off few blinders.\nOn the other hand, people will still opt for easy cartoon ideologies over the indisputable truth about the ferocious predatory predilections of all \"sides\" of humanity.\nThank god for visionary humorists like Kusturica.\n163 of 204 people found this review
