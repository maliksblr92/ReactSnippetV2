Miller close Michael E. Miller Local enterprise reporter covering immigration, poverty, inequality and crime EmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow December 20, 2017 at 9:10 AM EST In September, an undercover informant led police into the woods of Maryland\u2019s Wheaton Regional Park, along trails with pastoral names like Deer Hollow and Oak Ridge, to patch of shovel-turned earth.\nInside the shallow grave, shredded, bloodstained sweatshirt hinted at horrific crime.\n\u201cThe victim had been stabbed over one-hundred times, decapitated, dismembered, and his heart had been excised from his chest and thrown into the grave,\u201d Montgomery County detectives wrote in court papers made public last month.\nThe grisly details drew widespread attention.\n\u201cSatanic murder,\u201d declared headline in the Sun.\nAuthorities haven\u2019t said why the unidentified victim was mutilated, but the British tabloid could, perhaps, be forgiven for jumping to conclusions.\nAD According to police, the killing was the work of La Mara Salvatrucha: violent street gang known as MS-13 with long history of satanism.\nAD \u2018People here live in fear\u2019: MS-13 menaces community seven miles from the White House Some of the gang\u2019s founders were devil-worshiping metal heads, according to experts.\nAnd although the connection has waned over the past 30 years, it can still be seen in MS-13\u2019s use of satanic nicknames, tattoos and other imagery.\nThe gang\u2019s devil horns hand sign is known as \u201cla garra,\u201d Spanish reference to Satan\u2019s claws.\nAnd some MS-13 members have told investigators that they committed their crimes at the behest of \u201cla bestia,\u201d or the Beast.\n\u201cThe beast wanted soul,\u201d an MS-13 member nicknamed Diabolical said after killing 15-year-old girl who\u2019d disrespected his satanic shrine, prosecutors told Houston courtroom earlier this year.\nAD The Mara Salvatrucha Stoners Mara Salvatrucha\u2019s satanic influences are as old as the gang itself.\nLong before it became known as MS-13, the gang was called the Mara Salvatrucha Stoners.\nAs the name suggests, it was founded by marijuana-smoking heavy metal fans in Los Angeles in the 1970s, according to Thomas Ward, an anthropology professor at the University of Southern California who has studied the gang.\nAD Originally, the gang was little more than club for teenage Salvadorans to get high and listen to music, Ward writes in his ethnography of the gang, \u201cGangsters Without Borders.\u201d\nIt bore little resemblance to other Latino gangs.\nInstead of baggy clothes, its members wore black leather jackets and tight, frayed jeans.\nBut it was also different than other stoner groups in one important respect.\nAD \u201cA few of its members were hard-core Satanists who worshipped the devil and went so far as to practice gruesome animal sacrifices,\u201d Ward writes.\n\u201cThese Satanists gave MSS its badass reputation for evil.\nAlthough the vast majority of these stoners never participated in these bloody ritual animal sacrifices or gave any thought to becoming Satanists, they banked on their gang\u2019s reputation for devil worship, which gave it and them an aura of mystery and terror.\u201d\nShe thought she\u2019d saved her daughter from MS-13 by smuggling her to the U.S. She was wrong.\nOne Mara Salvatrucha member told Ward of his initiation into the gang.\nAD \u201cWe went to cemetery and swore an oath by drinking each other\u2019s blood,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe took knife and cut our hands and then drained our blood into cup to drink it.\nWe smoked lot of mota marijuana and then we cut open cat.\u201d\nAD In the 1980s, wave of Salvadorans fleeing the country\u2019s civil war including some who had fought in the conflict bolstered the gang but also began to change it.\nMS morphed into more traditional street gang that offered Salvadorans protection from black and Latino gangs.\nOver time, MS outstripped its local rivals in sheer brutality.\nIts members became hardened by prison, where they adopted what Ward calls the \u201ccholo\u201d style of dress common in other Latino gangs.\nIt was also inside California\u2019s penitentiaries that MS earned the \u201c13\u201d now in its name by aligning with the Mexican Mafia, powerful prison gang known as la eMe, or \u201cThe M\u201d the 13th letter of the alphabet.\nAD One thing that didn\u2019t change, however, was the gang\u2019s association with satanism.\nAD \u201cWhen MSS became MS, it kept its reputation for Satan worship,\u201d Ward writes, \u201cwhich gave it an aura of demonic mystery.\u201d\n\u2018Scattering the organs on the ground in pentagonal shape\u2019 By the mid 1990s when L.A.\u2019s soaring gang violence pushed it past D.C. for the title of America\u2019s murder capital officials had come to recognize MS-13 as public safety threat.\nStarting in President Bill Clinton\u2019s second term, the administration sought to tamp down gang violence in the U.S. by deporting thousands of MS-13 members to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\nBut the strategy backfired.\nIn the weakly governed, war-ravaged countries of the Northern Triangle, the gang was able to reconstitute itself and then rapidly grow in strength, according to two-part history of the gang published in the online Spanish-language newspaper El Faro.\nOver the past 20 years, MS-13 and its rival, 18th Street, have carved up territory in Central America, said federal law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nAD AD \u201cIf you grow up in one of these havens, that\u2019s it.\nYou are MS because your father was MS and your grandfather was MS,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd for you to be able to walk down the street and get Coca-Cola or what have you, you have to make sure you are part of something so you\u2019re not preyed upon.\nThat\u2019s their safety net.\u201d\nIn these gang-controlled neighborhoods, satanism persisted.\n\u201cWhat the two gangs do have in common is the belief that life and death are somehow intermingled,\u201d Pablo Trincia wrote in the Independent.\n\u201cThis belief partly explains the bones and devils tattooed on their bodies, as well as their satanic rituals, such as hacking victim to death and scattering the organs on the ground in pentagonal shape.\u201d\nAD As MS-13 violence returned to the United States with vengeance in the mid 2000s including spate of high profile murders in the Washington region so did reports of the gang\u2019s satanism.\nAD MS-13 gains recruits and power in U.S. as teens surge across border \u201cThe brutality of the gangs\u2019 crimes is increasingly horrific,\u201d the Los Angeles Times reported in 2004.\n\u201cHomicide victims, including many women and teenage girls, often are found so mutilated that Spanish priest Jose Maria Morataya, who runs San Salvador rehabilitation and job training center for former gang members suspects that some gang members practice satanic rituals.\u201d\nyear later, the Virginia Gang Investigators Association hosted seminar for law enforcement officials on MS-13 and satanism.\n\u201cWhat we are doing is making sure local police are prepared when they show up,\u201d Randy Crank, the association\u2019s president, told the Associated Press.\nAD \u2018Sometimes the devil asked you to do things for him\u2019 No seminar could prepare American officials for someone like Jose Del Cid.\nBy the time he came to the United States illegally from El Salvador in 2012, the then-16-year-old was already seasoned killer, he testified in federal court last year.\nAD His first victim was nearly his own mother.\nShe kicked him out of the house when he was 9.\nMembers of an MS-13 clique, the Park View Locos Salvatrucha, or PVLS, found him sleeping by river and took him in.\nOne of the gang members gave Del Cid shotgun and sent him home to kill his mom.\nBarely old enough to hold the weapon, he raised it to his mother\u2019s face and pulled the trigger but it didn\u2019t go off, he testified.\nFor two years, Del Cid served as paro, or errand boy, delivering weapons and drugs between gang members.\nAt 11, he was promoted after assisting in the deadly ambush of Coca-Cola delivery truck driver who belonged to 18th Street.\nTwo years later, Del Cid was given the chance to become full-fledged member, or \u201chomeboy,\u201d when his clique captured another 18th Street member.\n\u201cThe homeboys had the dude tied up by river,\u201d Del Cid testified in U.S. District Court in Alexandria last year as part of sweeping federal case against the gang in Northern Virginia.\n\u201cThey gave me machete and all had to do was slash at him.\u201d\nAD The gang \u201ccut him up and threw him into bag and into the river,\u201d Del Cid said.\nAfterward, Del Cid was officially \u201cjumped in\u201d as homeboy with beating that lasted 13 seconds.\nAfter involvement in third killing in El Salvador, Del Cid decided he \u201cwanted to get away from all that\u201d by coming to the United States.\nIt\u2019s unclear how he entered the country.\nDel Cid did not respond to questions sent to him through an attorney.\nWhat is clear is that once in Alexandria, he quickly joined the local PVLS clique.\nWithin months of arriving, Del Cid was involved in string of brutal attacks.\nHe admitted to stabbing 12-year-old boy in the chest \u201cjust to scare him\u201d \u201cif had wanted to kill him, would have gone for his neck,\u201d he said pulling gun on another teen, robbing drug dealer, attacking one-armed man with hammer and making plans to kill two people, including another MS-13 member.\nIn October 2013, when Del Cid was 17, he helped murder fellow gang member suspected of snitching, he said.\nBut the body proved too big for the shallow grave in Holmes Run Park in Fairfax County.\n\u201cSo we grabbed the machete and began to go at the legs,\u201d Del Cid testified.\n\u201cAnd then we doubled them over and stuck them in the hole as well.\u201d\nDel Cid and other gang members later dug up the body and moved it deeper into the woods, covering it in acid \u201cto dissolve the body more quickly,\u201d he said.\ncouple of months later, when he was 18, Del Cid helped kill another gang member suspected of stealing from the gang and sleeping with another gang member\u2019s girlfriend.\nThe victim\u2019s head was cut off and buried with his body in shallow grave, again in Holmes Run Park.\nIn June 2014, Del Cid and two fellow MS-13 members were \u201con patrol\u201d in Alexandria when they attacked someone they mistakenly thought belonged to the 18th Street gang.\nAfter an MS-13 member nicknamed \u201cTaliban\u201d shot the man, Del Cid and the gunman fled into the woods.\n\u201cI told you, homeboy, that what wanted was to feed the beast,\u201d Taliban told him as they fled, Del Cid testified.\n\u201cLet\u2019s pray, homeboy,\u201d said Taliban, whose real name is Jesus Alejandro Chavez.\n\u201cI have already fed the beast.\nNow we have to pray to the beast that we will not be caught.\u201d\n\u201cThe beast basically is the devil,\u201d Del Cid explained in court.\n\u201cWhen you are involved in MS-13 you feel that the devil is helping you, and sometimes the devil asked you to do things for him.\u201d\nDel Cid and Taliban made devil horns with their hands and joined them together to pray for deliverance from police.\nBut the devil wasn\u2019t listening.\nDel Cid was arrested two weeks later.\nHe eventually cooperated with authorities, pleading guilty to the pair of murders he committed as an 18-year-old and testifying at trial against 12 other MS-13 members in exchange for placement in the witness protection program while in prison and possible early release.\nTestifying earned him \u201cgreen light,\u201d or death sentence, from his old gang, he said in court.\nYet it also offered him something immigrating to the U.S. had not: escape from MS-13.\n\u201cI also saw that as an opportunity to get out of all this,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause if one is sent back to the prison with all the locos, then you end up killing again.\u201d\nRead more Retropolis: Brutally killed by Charles Manson\u2019s followers, Sharon Tate became the face of victims\u2019 rights Hugh Hefner, the murder
