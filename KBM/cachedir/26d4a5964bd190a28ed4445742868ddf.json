"text_raw": "Aside from reproduction, sex can be about intimacy and pleasure.\nSexual activity, penile-vaginal intercourse PVI or masturbation, can offer many surprising benefits to all facets of your life: physical intellectual emotional psychological social Sexual health is more than avoiding diseases and unplanned pregnancies.\nIt's also about recognizing that sex can be an important part of your life, according to the American Sexual Health Association.\nHow can sex benefit your body?\nThis study suggests that sex can be good cardiovascular exercise in younger men and women.\nThough sex isn't enough exercise on its own, it can be considered light exercise.\nSome of the benefits you can get from sex include: lowering blood pressure burning calories increasing heart health strengthening muscles reducing your risk of heart disease, stroke, and hypertension increasing libido People with active sex lives tend to exercise more frequently and have better dietary habits than those who are less sexually active.\nPhysical fitness may also improve sexual performance overall.\nNine ways to improve your sexual performance\u00bb Stronger immune system In study of immunity in people in romantic relationships, people who had frequent sex one to two times week had more immunoglobulin IgA in their saliva.\nPeople who had infrequent sex less than once week had significantly less IgA.\nIgA is the antibody that plays role in preventing illnesses and is the first line of defense against human papillomavirus, or HPV.\nBut those who had sex more than three times week had the same amount of IgA as those who had infrequent sex.\nThe study suggests that anxiety and stress can possibly cancel out the positive effects of sex.\nBetter sleep Your body releases oxytocin, also called the \"love\" or \"intimacy\" hormone, and endorphins during an orgasm.\nThe combination of these hormones can act as sedation.\nBetter sleep can contribute to: stronger immune system longer lifespan feeling more well-rested having more energy during the day Headache relief Another study shows that sexual activity can provide full or partial relief from migraines and cluster headaches.\nOne study found that men who averaged having 4.6 to ejaculations week were 36 percent less likely to receive prostate cancer diagnosis before the age of 70.\nThis is in comparison to men who reported ejaculating 2.3 or fewer times week on average.\nFor men, sex may even affect your mortality.\nOne study that had 10 year follow-up reported that men who had frequent orgasms defined as two or more week had 50 percent lower mortality risk than those who had sex less often.\nAlthough results are conflicting, the quality and health of your sperm may increase with increased sexual activity, as some research suggests.\nIn women Having an orgasm increases blood flow and releases natural pain-relieving chemicals.\nSexual activity in women can: improve bladder control reduce incontinence relieve menstrual and premenstrual cramps improve fertility build stronger pelvic muscles help produce more vaginal lubrication potentially protect you against endometriosis, or the growing of tissue outside your uterus The act of sex can help strengthen your pelvic floor.\nstrengthened pelvic floor can also offer benefits like less pain during sex and reduced chance of vaginal prolapse.\nOne study shows that PVI can result in reflexive vaginal contractions caused by penile thrusting.\nWomen who continue to be sexually active after menopause are less likely to have significant vaginal atrophy, or the thinning of vaginal walls.\nVaginal atrophy can cause pain during sex and urinary symptoms.\nHow can sex benefit your mental health?\nSexual activity, with partner or through masturbation, can provide important psychological and emotional benefits.\nLike exercise, sex can help reduce stress and anxiety and increase happiness.\nResearch found that sexually active adults between 50 to 90 years old had better memory.\nThey were also less likely to feel depressed and lonely.\nConfidence booster Frequent sexual activity, whether with partner or alone, can make you look younger.\nThis is partially due to the release of estrogen during sex.\nOne study found correlation between frequent sexual activity and looking significantly younger between seven to 12 years younger The majority of these individuals were also comfortable expressing their sexuality and sexual identity.\nSocial benefits Sex can help you connect to your partner, thanks to oxytocin.\nOxytocin can play role in developing relationships.\nYou may find that consistent, mutual sexual pleasure helps with bonding within relationship.\nCoupled partners often have increased relationship satisfaction when they fulfill one another's sexual desires.\nYou may find positive growth in your relationship when you're able to express yourself and your sexual desires.\nWhat are the benefits of masturbation?\nMasturbation can offer many of the same benefits as sex, but also has its own advantages, including: enhanced sex between partners understanding your own body increased ability for orgasms boosted self-esteem and body image increased sexual satisfaction treatment for sexual dysfunction Masturbation is considered entirely safe and with fewer health risks attached.\nWhen practiced alone, there is no risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections STIs According to Planned Parenthood, it increases mental well- being not mental illness or instability like some myths suggest.\nCelibacy and abstinence Sex isn't the only indicator of health or happiness.\nYou can still lead an active and happy life without sex.\nThe benefits of sex come from the feeling of pleasure, which studies show can also come from listening to music, interacting with pets, and having strong religious faith.\nAccording to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, long-term study of nuns reported that many of them lived well into their 90s and past 100 years old.\nTakeaway Sex is an important part of life and overall well-being.\nIn relationships, orgasms play significant part in bonding.\nPhysical and emotional benefits like reduced risk of heart disease, improved self-esteem, and more can come from having sex.\nYou can still have similar benefits without sex.\nEngaging in other pleasurable activities like exercising, interacting with pet, and having strong network of friends could potentially offer the same benefits.\nSex is just one way of improving your quality of life.\nBut if sex is part of your life, due to relationship or desire, it's important to be able to communicate and experience sexual satisfaction.\nYou may find relief and an increase in happiness when you take the time to have sex.\nQ: Is there such thing as too much sex including masturbation A: Sexual desire and activity change through the life span.\nMasturbation begins in puberty, is common in both sexes, can be frequent, and continues throughout the life span.\nSexual activity is at its highest at the beginning of relationship.\nWith aging sexual desire or activity may slow.\nSex is good for your psychological health and immune function.\nHaving frequent orgasms is healthy, having many sexual partners and unprotected sex is not.\nBut sexual addiction and chronic masturbation can become problem.\nIf your abundant sexual activity is causing you distress do seek help.\nSpeak with your doctor; there is treatment.\nDebra Rose Wilson, PhD, MSN, RN, IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHTAnswers
