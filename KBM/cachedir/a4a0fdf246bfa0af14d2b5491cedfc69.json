"Satan From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search This article is about the specific figure in the Abrahamic religions that seduces humans into sin.\nFor personifications of evil in various cultures and religious traditions around the world, see Devil.\nFor other uses, see Satan disambiguation Figure in Abrahamic religions Illustration of the Devil on folio 290 recto of the Codex Gigas dating to the early thirteenth century Satan ,[a] also known as the Devil ,[b] is an entity in the Abrahamic religions that seduces humans into sin or falsehood.\nIn Christianity and Islam, he is usually seen as either fallen angel or genie, who used to possess great piety and beauty, but rebelled against God, who nevertheless allows him temporary power over the fallen world and host of demons.\nIn Judaism, Satan is typically regarded as metaphor for the yetzer hara or \"evil inclination\", or as an agent subservient to God.\nfigure known as \"the satan\" first appears in the Tanakh as heavenly prosecutor, member of the sons of God subordinate to Yahweh, who prosecutes the nation of Judah in the heavenly court and tests the loyalty of Yahweh's followers by forcing them to suffer.\nDuring the intertestamental period, possibly due to influence from the Zoroastrian figure of Angra Mainyu, the satan developed into malevolent entity with abhorrent qualities in dualistic opposition to God.\nIn the apocryphal Book of Jubilees, Yahweh grants the satan referred to as Mastema authority over group of fallen angels, or their offspring, to tempt humans to sin and punish them.\nIn the Synoptic Gospels, Satan tempts Jesus in the desert and is identified as the cause of illness and temptation.\nIn the Book of Revelation, Satan appears as Great Red Dragon, who is defeated by Michael the Archangel and cast down from Heaven.\nHe is later bound for one thousand years, but is briefly set free before being ultimately defeated and cast into the Lake of Fire.\nIn Christianity, Satan is also known as the Devil and, although the Book of Genesis does not mention him, he is often identified as the serpent in the Garden of Eden.\nIn the Middle Ages, Satan played minimal role in Christian theology and was used as comic relief figure in mystery plays.\nDuring the early modern period, Satan's significance greatly increased as beliefs such as demonic possession and witchcraft became more prevalent.\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, belief in the existence of Satan became harshly criticized.\nNonetheless, belief in Satan has persisted, particularly in the Americas.\nIn the Quran, Shaitan, also known as Iblis, is an entity made of fire who was cast out of Heaven because he refused to bow before the newly-created Adam and incites humans to sin by infecting their minds with wasw\u0101s \"evil suggestions\" Although Satan is generally viewed as evil, some groups have very different beliefs.\nIn Theistic Satanism, Satan is considered deity who is either worshipped or revered.\nIn LaVeyan Satanism, Satan is symbol of virtuous characteristics and liberty.\nSatan's appearance is never described in the Bible, but, since the ninth century, he has often been shown in Christian art with horns, cloven hooves, unusually hairy legs, and tail, often naked and holding pitchfork.\nThese are an amalgam of traits derived from various pagan deities, including Pan, Poseidon, and Bes.\nSatan appears frequently in Christian literature, most notably in Dante Alighieri's Inferno variants of the Faust legend, John Milton's Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained and the poems of William Blake.\nHe continues to appear in film, television, and music.\nConservative Judaism generally rejects the Talmudic interpretation of Satan as metaphor for the yetzer hara and regard him as literal agent of God.[57] Orthodox Judaism, on the other hand, outwardly embraces Talmudic teachings on Satan, and involves Satan in religious life far more inclusively than other sects.\nMichael and his angels fought against Dragon.\nDragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in Heaven.\nDuring the early modern period, exorcisms were seen as displays of God's power over Satan.[135] During the early modern period, witches were widely believed to engage in sexually explicit Satanic rituals with demons,[142] such as the one shown in this illustration by Martin van Ma\u00eble in the 1911 edition of Satanism and Witchcraft by Jules Michelet.\nAccording to the Book of Moses, the Devil offered to be the redeemer of mankind for the sake of his own glory.\nConversely, Jesus offered to be the redeemer of mankind so that his father's will would be done.\nAfter his offer was rejected, Satan became rebellious and was subsequently cast out of heaven.[164] In the Book of Moses, Cain is said to have \"loved Satan more than God\"[165] and conspired with Satan to kill Abel.\nIt was through this pact that Cain became Master Mahan.[166] The Book of Moses also says that Moses was tempted by Satan before calling upon the name of the \"Only Begotten\", which caused Satan to depart.\nIbn Abbas asserts that the word jinn could be applied to earthly jinn, but also to \"fiery angels\" like Satan.[187] Hasan of Basra, an eminent Muslim theologian who lived in the seventh century AD, was quoted as saying: \"Iblis was not an angel even for the time of an eye wink.\nWomen are the ropes of Satan.\nHe is regarded as cosmic force for separation, despair and spiritual envelopment.\nIn this religion, \"Satan\" is not viewed or depicted as hubristic, irrational, and fraudulent creature, but rather is revered with Prometheus-like attributes, symbolizing liberty and individual empowerment.\nTo adherents, he also serves as conceptual framework and an external metaphorical projection of the Satanist's highest personal potential.[220][221][222][223][224] In his essay \"Satanism: The Feared Religion\", the current High Priest of the Church of Satan, Peter H. Gilmore, further expounds that \"...Satan is symbol of Man living as his prideful, carnal nature dictates.\nThe reality behind Satan is simply the dark evolutionary force of entropy that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for survival and propagation inherent in all living things.\nIn fact, there is no entity in Yazidism which represents evil in opposition to God; such dualism is rejected by Yazidis.[230] In the Middle Ages, the Cathars, practitioners of dualistic religion, were accused of worshipping Satan by the Catholic Church.\nPope Gregory IX stated in his work Vox in Rama that the Cathars believed that God had erred in casting Lucifer out of heaven and that Lucifer would return to reward his faithful.\nDante in Inferno Canto XXXIV Verse translation by Allen Mandelbaum Here we may reign secure, and in my choice to reign is worth ambition though in Hell: Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.\nDuring the fifth century, musical interval called the tritone became known as \"the devil in Music\" and was banned by the Catholic Church.[279] Giuseppe Tartini was inspired to write his most famous work, the Violin Sonata in minor, also known as \"The Devil's Trill\", after dreaming of the Devil playing the violin.\nLater, Robert Johnson claimed that he had sold his soul in return for becoming great blues guitarist.[282] Satanic symbolism appears in rock music from the 1960s.\nMick Jagger assumes the role of Lucifer in the Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" 1968 ,[279] while Black Sabbath portrayed the Devil in numerous songs, including \"War Pigs\" 1970 and \"N.I.B.\"\n1970 .[283] See also Cernunnos Hades Hel Krampus Man of sin Prince of Darkness Satan Prince of Darkness Manichaeism Set deity Notes 1.\nHebrew: \u05e9\u05b8\u05bc\u05c2\u05d8\u05b8\u05df s\u00e2tan meaning \"enemy\" or \"adversary\";[1] Ancient Greek: \u03c3\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u1fb6\u03c2 or \u03c3\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd ho satanas or satan ;[2] Arabic: \u0634\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0646 shaitan meaning \"astray\", \"distant\", or sometimes \"devil\" 2.\nThe Latin Vulgate translation of this passage renders Heylel as \"Lucifer\"[109] and this name continues to be used by some Christians as an alternative name for Satan.[109] References 1.\nKelly 2006, pp.\nBoyd 1975, p. 13.\nKelly 2006, pp.\nKelly 2006, pp.\nKelly 2006, p. 114.\nKelly 2006, pp.\nKelly 2006, pp.\nCampo 2009, p. 603.\nKelly 2006, pp.\nButtrick, George Arthur; The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, An illustrated Encyclopedia 11.\nStephen M.
