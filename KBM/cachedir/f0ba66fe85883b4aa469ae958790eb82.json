each other reproductively.\nSex, sexuality, and reproduction are all closely woven into the fabric of living things.\nAll relate to the propagation of the race and the survival of the species.\nYet there can be sex without sexuality, and reproduction need not be sexual, although for most forms of life sexual reproduction is essential for both propagation and long-term survival.\nSexual and nonsexual reproduction Because the life span of all individual forms of life, from microbes to man, is limited, the first concern of any particular population is to produce successors.\nThis is reproduction, pure and simple.\nAmong lower animals and plants it may be accomplished without involving eggs and sperm.\nFerns, for example, shed millions of microscopic, nonsexual spores, which are capable of growing into new plants if they settle in suitable environment.\nMany higher plants also reproduce by nonsexual means.\nBulbs bud off new bulbs from the side.\nCertain jellyfish, sea anemones, marine worms, and other lowly creatures bud off parts of the body during one season or another, each thereby giving rise to populations of new, though identical, individuals.\nAt the microscopic level, single-celled organisms reproduce continually by growing and dividing successively to give rise to enormous populations of mostly identical descendants.\nAll such reproduction depends on the capacity of cells to grow and divide, which is basic property of life.\nIn the case of most animals, however, particularly the higher forms, reproduction by nonsexual means is apparently incompatible with the structural complexity and activity of the individual.\nAlthough nonsexual reproduction is exploited by some creatures to produce very large populations under certain circumstances, it is of limited value in terms of providing the variability necessary for adaptive advantages.\nSuch so-called vegetative forms of reproduction, whether of animals or plants, result in individuals that are genetically identical with the parent.\nIf some adverse environmental change should occur, all would be equally affected and none might survive.\nAt the best, therefore, nonsexual reproduction can be valuable and perhaps an essential means of propagation, but it does not exclude the need for sexual reproduction.\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with

changing circumstances.\nIn effect it is kind of double assurance that the race or species will persist for an indefinite time.\nThe great difference between the two types of reproduction is that individual organisms resulting from nonsexual reproduction have but single parent and are essentially alike, whereas those resulting from sexual reproduction have two parents and are never exact replicas of either.\nSexual reproduction thus introduces variability, in addition to its propagative function.\nBoth types of reproduction represent the capacity of individual cells to develop into whole organisms, given suitable circumstances.\nSex is therefore something that has been combined with this primary function and is responsible for the capacity of race to adapt to new environmental conditions.\nSex cells The term sex is variously employed.\nIn the broad sense it includes everything from the sex cells to sexual behaviour.\nPrimary sex, which is generally all that distinguishes one kind of individual from another in the case of many lower animals, denotes the capacity of the reproductive gland, or gonad, to produce either sperm cells or eggs or both.\nIf only sperm cells are produced, the reproductive gland is testis, and the primary sex of the tissue and the individual possessing it is male.\nIf only eggs are produced, the reproductive gland is an ovary, and the primary sex is female.\nIf the gland produces both sperm and eggs, either simultaneously or successively, the condition is known as hermaphroditic.\nAn individual, therefore, is male or female or hermaphrodite primarily according to the nature of the gonad.\nAs rule, male and female complement each other at all levels of organization: as sex cells; as individuals with either testes or ovaries; and as individuals with anatomical, physiological, and behavioral differences associated with the complemental roles they play during the whole reproductive process.\nThe role of the male individual is to deliver sperm cells in enormous numbers in the right place and at the right time to fertilize eggs of female individuals of the same species.\nThe role of the female individual is to deliver or otherwise offer eggs capable of being fertilized under precise circumstances.\nIn the case of hermaphrodite organisms, animal or plant, various devices are employed to ensure cross-fertilization, or cross- pollination, so that full advantage of double parentage is obtained.\nThe basic requirement of sexual reproduction is that reproductive cells of different parentage come together and fuse in pairs.\nSuch cells will be genetically different to significant degree, and it is this feature that is essential to the long-term well-being of the race.\nThe other sexual distinctions, between the two types of sex cell and between two individuals of different sex, are secondary differences connected with ways and means of attaining the end.\nEnter your email Subscribe By signing up for this
