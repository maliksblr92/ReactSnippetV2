The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which. George Orwell, Animal Farm People who say they hate Black Mirror are usually talking about episodes like \u201cMetalhead.\u201d\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong.\nthink there\u2019s plenty to recommend in this tight little installment, the shortest of season four.\nAs staged and shot by director David Slade, it features sequences as tense as anything I\u2019ve seen onscreen in 2017.\nAnd its portrayal of the \u201cdogs\u201d robotic super killing machines, whose origin is never explained though you can make your guesses works precisely because it doesn\u2019t try to tell you what they are or where they came from.\nThat said, I\u2019m guessing the choice to shoot the episode in black and white, which feels mostly inexplicable, was done to cover up the slightly unreal quality of the visual effects in regards to the dogs.\nRelated In Black Mirror season 4, humanism triumphs over nihilism but only barely But by the time got to the end of \u201cMetalhead,\u201d found myself wondering just what the whole thing was supposed to be about.\nThe last shot is nonsensical, and the tale itself seems to indulge in the sort of grim nihilism that Black Mirror is often accused of but rarely guilty of.\nIt felt like it was missing key five-second insert shot that would suddenly make everything click into place.\nBut instead, we\u2019re left with what\u2019s actually onscreen.\nAnd what\u2019s actually onscreen is nasty, brutish, and mercifully short.\n\u201cMetalhead\u201d offers rapid descent into post-apocalyptic future \u201cMetalhead\u201d opens with the disinterested observations of Bella, Clarke, and Anthony, three scavengers in what\u2019s immediately clear is post-apocalyptic wasteland.\nThey pass farm, and discuss how pigs used to roam there.\nBut there are no pigs now.\nThe dogs, it would seem, killed them.\nIn the future of \u201cMetalhead,\u201d \u201cdogs\u201d are autonomous robotic creatures, which reminded me of the robotic dogs that were briefly hot holiday toy few years ago.\nBut these dogs are equipped with all manner of ruthless tools, from scanners used to track down human beings to guns implanted in one of their limbs.\nOur trio thinks the warehouse they pull up to on supply run is dog-free, but right when they find the box they were looking for highlighted by the handy serial number scrawled on Bella\u2019s hand they also find dog resting right behind it, which quickly dispatches Clarke and Anthony, leaving Bella racing through the wilderness, trying to stay one step ahead of her tireless pursuer.\nIt is, in other words, The Terminator but with wordless, nearly noiseless but for the whirring of metallic parts antagonist.\nIt reminded me bit of the American naturalism of writers like Jack London, transported to the United Kingdom.\nThe dog might as well stand in for the forces of nature, for as relentlessly as it pursues Bella, even trapping her up tree overnight, which definitely feels like something out of London\u2019s work.\nBella makes desperate escape.\nNetflix The dog\u2019s pursuit of Bella takes up most of the episode\u2019s running time, and it is thrilling to watch as writer Charlie Brooker slowly reveals the many ways the dog tracks its prey, even after its own death.\nSimilarly, Bella\u2019s ingenuity at evading the dog makes her character who\u2019s easy to get invested in.\nMaxine Peake\u2019s performance confines almost all of its terror to her darting eyes.\nThe rest of her is just ready to run at moment\u2019s notice, and that quality makes several scenes throughout the episode almost unbearably tense.\nBut at the risk of overinflating genre exercise that doesn\u2019t need to be overinflated what does it all mean?\nit\u2019s clear from that early conversation about dead pigs and the episode\u2019s ending in which Bella defeats the dog pursuing her, only to be stung by its trackers, which will bring hordes more of them to her door that this is supposed to be about something larger, something to do with humanity.\nThat becomes all the more clear when we learn that the item our trio was scavenging from the warehouse, revealed only in the episode\u2019s final shot, was teddy bear, meant to make the final few days of child\u2019s life more bearable.\nThis lands somewhere between affectionate exasperation for humanity\u2019s foibles and sick joke.\nJust what is \u201cMetalhead\u201d trying to say?\nHave you seen the little piggies, crawling in the dirt?\nThe more think about \u201cMetalhead,\u201d the more think it found exactly the wrong balance between too much information and too little.\nIt explains just enough about the dogs to leave you wanting to know more, and frustrated when you don\u2019t, but it also maybe explains too much to leave them satisfying mystery.\nIf they were stranger, more alien, we might have spent more time wondering if they were humanity\u2019s creation, come to wipe us out, or alien invaders.\nAs it stands, they just seem like robots, and the result is robot uprising tale that feels little underdone.\nThis is why keep coming back to that early conversation about pigs.\nthink what Brooker and Slade are going for here is story about the grim reality of going from predator to prey.\nAfter all, pigs in their wild state are destructive forces that will eat just about anything and don\u2019t much care about the aftermath of their destruction.\nReally, that sounds like humanity, in way, something that George Orwell also observed years and years ago.\nThis is hammered home in the way the dogs kill human beings: single strike to the head that\u2019s reminiscent of the way animals are killed on slaughterhouse floor.\nNo, the dogs aren\u2019t consuming humans for meat, but lot of the principles are roughly the same.\nspent long time trying to find out if Brooker is vegetarian.\nIt seems he\u2019s probably not, but old restaurant reviews he wrote seem to suggest he\u2019s certainly thought about the ethics of consuming meat long and hard.\nStill, this is just me guessing.\nProbably, should be happy about this better to be too open to interpretation than too didactic, after all.\nBut the way that \u201cMetalhead\u201d conflates Bella\u2019s seeming eventual suicide after realizing how many trackers are embedded beneath her skin with that open box of teddy bears suggests deeper, larger meaning that is either insultingly shallow look at us silly humans, going out of our way for our dumb creature comforts when they\u2019re largely unnecessary or willfully obtuse.\nAfter all, Bella is collecting the bear for young relative.\nNow that humanity\u2019s entire existence is at stake, why does the life of one child matter more than the life of another?\nAnd yet we can\u2019t escape the hardwired belief that because it\u2019s our child or, in Bella\u2019s case, nephew little piece of our own DNA might survive into the future, no matter how long.\nIt\u2019s the reason we\u2019ve survived as species, and \u201cMetalhead\u201d suggests it\u2019s reason we might die, too, long series of small-scale incidences of individuals putting the well-being of them and theirs ahead of all of us and all of ours.\nSo maybe that\u2019s what \u201cMetalhead\u201d means to say.\nWe are as much victim of our programming as the dogs easily thwarted by bucket of paint over their sensors are.\nWe\u2019re ruthless in some contexts and quite stupid and soft in others.\ndon\u2019t think liked \u201cMetalhead,\u201d but perhaps just haven\u2019t figured out the right
